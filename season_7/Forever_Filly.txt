:'''Sassy Saddles''': [panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to... Oh! I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!
:'''Rarity''': [humming] Oh, I know. I love it so much, I gave it its own term – "Spring-sition"! [laughs]
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Ohhh. I like that. [sighs] I'm going to have to relabel ''all'' my binders. Right after we finish... ''everything''! We still have so much to do! Oh, my bustles and bows! Rarity, did we—?
:'''Rarity''': Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear.
:'''Sassy Saddles''': [sighs] Oh. Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low! And when I say "temporarily low", I mean "completely out of"—!
:'''Rarity''': The baby blue sapphires? They arrived this morning.
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Oh. Heh. Wonderful. [sighs] Oh! What about the design for the—?!
:'''Rarity''': And done!
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Wow. You ''are'' good. And you've really outdone yourself this time! The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, thank you. Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks. But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered.
:'''Sassy Saddles''': You're right. You're right. There are no cracks.
:'''Rarity''': Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back? And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
:'''Sassy Saddles''': My most certain pleasure!
:'''Rarity''': Oh. I love this picture. When was the last time we had that kind of fun together? [gasps] Why, I can't remember! Has it been that long?! I guess I've been so busy running my shop! [gasps] Oh, no! Something, or should I say somepony, ''is'' slipping between the cracks! [sobs] I miss my Sweetie Belle! [sobs]
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin.
:'''Rarity''': Huh? [bawls]
:'''Sassy Saddles''': I... I can order more!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Rarity''': [continues bawling] And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses. And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari. [sobs] So many wonderful memories! [sobs, blows nose, resumes sobbing] Not to put too fine a point on it, but... [bawls harder] Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up. I miss her so much!
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Then why don't you go visit her?
:'''Rarity''': [through tears] I wish I... could, but... between... running... three stores and the spring-sition... I couldn't possibly...
:'''Sassy Saddles''': But you've already done almost all the work. I can handle the rest.
:'''Rarity''': B-B-But... but...
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Rarity, go. I have everything well in hoof.
:'''Rarity''': [sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Way to immediately turn ''that'' around.
:'''Rarity''': We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!
:'''Sassy Saddles''': I'm sure she'd love that.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, Sassy, thank you!
:'''Sassy Saddles''': Of course! Now get out of here!
:'''Rarity''': I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!

:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [giggling]
:'''Starry Eyes''': [screams]
:'''Scootaloo''': Excuse us!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Comin' through!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [giggling, screaming]
:[crash!]
:'''Scootaloo''': That was fun! Let's do it again!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Scoot, we've got a job to do.
:'''Scootaloo''': Later?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': All right, Chipcutter. We've done ''our'' part. The rest is up to you.
:'''Chipcutter''': You ''really'' think I have it in me to be a sculptor?
:'''Scootaloo''': Yup!
:'''Chipcutter''': But why?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?
:'''Chipcutter''': Yeah. I can't help it. When I look at my sandwich, it's like it's just asking me to... turn it into a dragon.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, what is ''this'' slab asking you to turn it into?
:'''Chipcutter''': Hmmm... I see...
:[jackhammering noises]
:[crumble]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Wow! T-That's incredible! It looks just like us!
:'''Scootaloo''': We knew you had it in you, Chip!
:'''Chipcutter''': This is ''way'' better than sandwich sculpting!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Chip, we're proud of you.
:[flash]
:'''Chipcutter''': I finally got my cutie mark!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Woo-hoo! All right!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yes!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Way to go!
:[hoof-bump]

:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs] Not a bad way to start a day.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Not a bad way at all! Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Another satisfied client!
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Scootaloo''': Mm-hmm!
:'''Apple Bloom''': So who's up next?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark – three puppy paw prints.
:'''Scootaloo''': When is she swinging by?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, I think she should be arriving right about...
:[door opens]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ...now.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Wow. You ''are'' good.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Come on in, Zipporwhill.
:'''Scootaloo''': Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?
:'''Zipporwhill''': It's my puppy, Ripley. We used to be so close. In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home. But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me.
:'''Scootaloo''': Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.
:'''Rarity''': [singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [gasps] Rarity? [grunts]
:'''Rarity''': Mmmm!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [laughs nervously]

:'''Rarity''': [to Zipporwhill] Oh! Heh-heh. So sorry, dear. You're tiny. I didn't even see you there! Tend to get carried away with my entrances! Ta-da! [laughs]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Rarity, what are ''you'' doing here?
:'''Rarity''': I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': No!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be ''très gauche''!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...
:'''Rarity''': Oh.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah! Go have fun.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You sure you two can handle our client here?
:'''Rarity''': "Client"? Oh, that is so adorable!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh, thanks? I think?
:'''Rarity''': [sniffs] Ooh! You have mints to offer your "clients". [giggles] How.. professional. [giggles]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Are you sure you two got this?
:'''Apple Bloom''': We have it handled.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble.
:'''Rarity''': Come on, come on! You'll never guess what I have planned! [squeals]

:[foals and Rarity giggling]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! So fun!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [indignantly] What?
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I ''did''.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all.
:'''Zipporwhill''': [struggling] Come on... [grunts]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!
:[music and silly sound effects]
:[foals and Rarity giggling]
:'''Rarity''': Banana peels are so very, very slippery! [laughs] It's funny because it's true! [laughs]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [laughs nervously, sighs]
:'''Rarity''': What's the matter, darling?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.
:'''Rarity''': What?! Since when?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.

:[bell dings]
:'''Rarity''': Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh... Yeah... Where is "here" exactly?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.
:'''Rarity''': And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert! [giggles, claps twice]
:[tray drops]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Huh. I remember it being much bigger.
:'''Rarity''': Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [slurps, gulps]
:'''Rarity''': Well?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I was thinking something more like a salad.
:'''Rarity''': A salad? When did you get so practical?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!
:[thump]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [groans]
:'''Ripley''': [panting]
:'''Zipporwhill''': Hey, Ripley!
:'''Scootaloo''': Look at me! Over here!
:[squeaking]
:'''Ripley''': [yawns]

:[balloon squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [groans]
:'''Rarity''': But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.
:'''Zipporwhill''': [baby noises] Who's a good puppy? Who's a good puppy?! ''You're'' the good puppy!
:'''Ripley''': [whines]
:'''Zipporwhill''': Now come on, puppy-wuppy! Get the bally-wally!
:'''Scootaloo''': Come on, Ripley! Like this!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Good Scootaloo! See?
:'''Ripley''': [barking]
:'''Zipporwhill''': [sighs] It's not working.
:'''Scootaloo''': Maybe if the ball tasted better?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I don't think that that's it, Scoot.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.
:'''Rarity''': Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': What?
:'''Rarity''': Oh nothing, nothing. Go on.
:'''Scootaloo''': Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, it's not exactly great...
:'''Apple Bloom''': What do you mean?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
:'''Scootaloo''': I wish we could say our day is going better.
:'''Ripley''': [barking]
:'''Apple Bloom''': But we can't.
:'''Scootaloo''': Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy...
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Gotta go...
:[balloons squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] I know just what to do with this!

:[fashion music]
:'''Rarity''': And pose!
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': And pose!
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': Love the camera!
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': Hate the camera.
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': Love it again!
:[camera clicks]
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the camera" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': No!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!
:[squeaking]
:'''Ripley''': [sniffing]
:'''Rarity''': W-What do you mean, no?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That's just it! I ''used'' to! That's not who I am anymore!
:'''Zipporwhill''': This isn't who I am! My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore! Hmph!
:'''Rarity''': But it ''is'' you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!
:'''Rarity''': [whimpering]

:'''Rarity''': [sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing ''her'' favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!
:[balloon deflating]

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?
:'''Zipporwhill''': They're with my puppy. He seems to like them better than me anyway.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Now, I'm sure that's not true.
:'''Zipporwhill''': It is. He doesn't like doing anything with me anymore. [sighs] He didn't even want to play with this. And all puppies love these. [sniffs]
:[squeak]
:'''Zipporwhill''': [sniffing, crying]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!
:[squeak]

:'''Ripley''': [yawns]
:'''Scootaloo''': [groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?
:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs] It's hopeless.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sweetie Belle!
:'''Scootaloo''': Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one.
:'''Rarity''': Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her ''quite'' the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?
:'''Zipporwhill''': My puppy?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That's not what ''I'' see. ''I'' see a full-grown dog.
:'''Zipporwhill''': He did get bigger, I guess.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': He's not just bigger. He's older, too.
:'''Ripley''': [grunts]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You don't still play with the same toys from when ''you'' were a foal, do you?
:'''Zipporwhill''': Oh. Ohhh. The squeaker is a little small for him now. [sighs] It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.
:'''Zipporwhill''': So... what do I do?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together.
:'''Zipporwhill''': You think so?
:'''Rarity''': I know so!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Rarity?!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are ''so'' right.
:'''Scootaloo''': About the dog?
:'''Rarity''': Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the ''last'' last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?
:[clicking]
:'''Ripley''': [alerted dog noise] [panting]
:'''Zipporwhill''': What is it, puppy? [giggles] I mean, ''Ripley''?
:'''Ripley''': [panting]
:'''Zipporwhill''': [giggling] I love you too, Ripley! Thank you, Crusaders.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': No problem!
:'''Apple Bloom''', '''Scootaloo''', and '''Zipporwhill''': [laughing]
:'''Zipporwhill''': Oh, Ripley!
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister.
:'''Rarity''': I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, I do have one idea...

:'''Rarity''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': [licking lips]
:'''Rarity''': Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh! I'll help you!
:'''Rarity''': [giggles]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [giggles]
