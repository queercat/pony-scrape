:[stomping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Remind me how this happened again!
:[crunch]
:'''Applejack''': And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. Mr. Tortoise-Snap said he was hungry. But he promised me he would only take a few small bites.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't think that thing knows what "small" is.
:'''Mr. Tortoise-Snap''': [gulps]
:[stomping]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:'''Rarity''': Spikey-Wikey!
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Mr. Tortoise-Snap''': [chomps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack and Pinkie, you distract him! Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, let's save Spike!
:'''Applejack''': [grunting]
:[whirring]
:'''Mr. Tortoise-Snap''': [low growl]
:[snap!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Mr. Tortoise-Snap, I'm only asking nicely once! Let my friend go!
:'''Mr. Tortoise-Snap''': [low growl]
:'''Spike''': Whoa! Whoa!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And now, a simple teleportation spell should—
:'''Princess Celestia''': ''Halt, interloper!''
:'''Princess Luna''': Stay back, friends! My sister and I will take care of the beast!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': All the times we've actually needed their help, and they show up for ''this''?
:[whooshing]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's just what ''I'' was about to do!
:'''Princess Luna''': [laughs] Goodness, sister! That was fun!
:'''Princess Celestia''': No need to thank us. To be honest, we've recently realized we like being part of the action.
:'''Princess Luna''': Experiencing life instead of just dreaming about it.
:'''Princess Celestia''': And making a difference outside the throne room.
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': Y'all think they're gonna be doin' this a lot?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[crunch]
:[splash]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my. We'd better ask somepony to fix that hole. It seems very dangerous.
:'''Princess Luna''': Which is why ''we're'' here!
:[whoosh]
:[thud]
:[ponies cheering]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] I can't read this thing. How am I supposed to lead a Filly Guides hike if the map makes us ''more'' lost?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Did somepony say "lost"?
:'''Princess Luna''': Not for long! [laughs]
:[zap!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [slurps]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, now, this is just terrible! Miss Cheerilee ordered cupcakes for school today, and I forgot to make the order!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ah, no biggie. We could—
:[crash!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Students going hungry? Not on our watch!
:'''Princess Luna''': Let us bake, sister!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[splattering]

:'''Applejack''': And then they carried Granny Smith across the street. There wasn't even any traffic!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
:'''Rarity''': But suddenly, Celestia and Luna seem to think we can't do anything on our own.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How are we supposed to learn to be rulers of Equestria with them fixing every teensy problem for us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe the princesses changed their minds. Maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting Equestria after all!
:'''Spike''': Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.
:[doors open]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ah! A strategy meeting! What is the danger this time? A rampaging beast? Evil spell? Friendship problem?
:'''Princess Luna''': We're ready to do whatever we can.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great. But is something wrong? It's just... You've been helping us an awful lot, and we know you have way more important ruler-y things to do, so...
:'''Princess Luna''': We've spent more than enough time in the throne room. Real life is happening out here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. That's what this is about? You're sick of being princesses?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...
:'''Princess Luna''': ...and the night patrolling dreams...
:'''Princess Celestia''': ...we wanted a chance to do the things ''you'' do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.
:'''Spike''': I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to! There's a lotta little things out there to do!
:'''Princess Celestia''': What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry. We'll cover your palace duties. It'll be a good chance for us to practice for when you retire.
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, if you're sure you don't mind the extra effort.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [scoffs]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Thank you, Twilight! What a relief to know the Royal Swanifying Ceremony is in good hooves. [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': The what now?

:'''Princess Celestia''': "Fun Not Yet Had". [squeals] I can't wait to start planning our time off!
:'''Princess Luna''': The chance to do whatever we want! And you know what that means!
{|
|
:'''Princess Celestia''':
:Adventure!
|
:'''Princess Luna''':
:Relaxation!
|}
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, it's just that I... I spend each night in everypony's intense dreams. So I could use some real-world downtime.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs] I understand. But for me, every day ''is'' real-world. Meetings and decrees and meetings about decrees and decrees about the meetings... I crave excitement!
:'''Princess Luna''': Uh, I'm not sure how we can both be happy. Unless...
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps] We take turns doing what we like!
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': Sister trip!
:'''Princess Luna''': And I have the perfect accessories for us to wear! Wait right here!
:[teleportation zap]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh. [nervous laugh] We'll be... twin-sies.
:'''Princess Luna''': [giggling] Just like regular pony tourists. I knew you'd love it.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I have a few things for us, too.
:[thud]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!
:'''Princess Luna''': [slurps, chews, coughs]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You have to add water. What do you think?
:'''Princess Luna''': It's perfect, sister.

:'''Princess Celestia''': And here are instructions of how to prepare for the Royal Swanifying.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If it's written down, I'm sure we can handle it. Have fun!
:'''Princess Luna''': One more thing. We're leaving you in charge of raising the sun and moon while we're gone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Princess Celestia''': We have put a small part of our power in this amulet. You can activate it with your magic at any time. Preferably dawn and dusk.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! That's not a terrifying level of responsibility or anything!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We won't let you down, princesses. [to Spike] Please tell me that scroll says what the the Royal Swanifying is.
:'''Spike''': Apparently it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake. We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.
:[swan squawks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': One question. ''Why?!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It doesn't matter. This is our chance to show Celestia and Luna we'll do whatever the job requires. If they can take care of all this themselves, then I know ''we'' can. Together.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um... hmm.
:'''Rarity''': Ah. Jolly good.
:'''Spike''': You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Remember, sister. From now on, we are regular, carefree ponies!
:[excited chattering]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Princess Luna''': We're leaving the princess life behind, and we're not even going to fly!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course. [laughs] How new and different. It's just like Pinkie Pie said.
{{#lst:Lotta Little Things|song}}
:[doors open]
:'''Fancy Pants''': Princesses, we are here to... Oh.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties. What can we help y'all with?
:'''Fancy Pants''': I say. How irregular. Well then. We offer our assistance as heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee.
:'''Rarity''': Ah, what a relief.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you, but we have it all covered.
:'''Fancy Pants''': Reeeeeally? Well, good luck with that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If we ask for help, it's just like admitting we're not as good at the job as Luna and Celestia are. Besides, how hard can throwing a swan party be?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot! Should I keep reading?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh]

:'''Princess Luna''': Uh, Celestia? Since we're both a little tired, m-maybe the first thing we do shouldn't be too wild.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Exactly what I was thinking.

:'''Princess Celestia''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!</span>''

:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. But now, we're going to do something ''I've'' always wanted to do but never could because of my night shift.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Is it another zip line?
:'''Princess Luna''': No.

:'''Princess Luna''': It's the post office!
:'''Princess Celestia''': It is indeed.
:'''Princess Luna''': Just think! All the mail in Ponyville goes through here! Isn't that amazing?!
:[thump]
:'''Princess Luna''': One stamp, please!
:[clattering]
:'''Princess Luna''': [licks] Wait for it...
:[watch ticking]
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.
:'''Princess Luna''': Yes, but ''I'' didn't give it to you. A mailpony took it from me, searched to find who it was meant for, and gave it to you! It's about the process!

:'''Princess Celestia''': [echoing] Did you know that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?
:[roaring]
:[rocks crunching]
:'''Princess Luna''': [flatly] I wonder why.

:'''Princess Luna''': I have always wanted to try this!
:[technopop]
:'''Princess Luna''': Isn't this wonderful, sister?
{{#lst:Lotta Little Things|reprise}}
:[inflating sounds]
:[doors open]
:'''Fancy Pants''': Princess Twilight! It has come to our attention that you don't intend to serve watercress at the Royal Swanifying Ceremony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's not enough in the castle kitchens to—
:'''Fancy Pants''': Don't tell ''me''. Tell ''him''.
:[swan squawks]
:'''Fancy Pants''': And you must do something about the garbage piling up outside. The street sweepers are on strike, and the royal carpeters can't do their jobs.
:'''Applejack''': Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, dear. I do hope those aren't the final decorations for the gala.
:'''Rarity''': How rude.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you for your constructive criticism. But we really don't have time to chat, so...
:[doors close]

:'''Princess Celestia''': [chewing, gulps] Well, I hope ''you're'' enjoying yourself on your super-relaxing picnic, sister.
:'''Princess Luna''': I would be if you hadn't made us hike through a million prickle bushes! [groans]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.
:'''Princess Luna''': That was ''Ponygliacci'', and it's an opera! And you made us leave early, even though it was still ''my'' turn.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!
:'''Princess Luna''': Because you don't want me to be happy. I always have to do things ''your'' way. I bet you wish I'd never come back so you could still rule day ''and'' night!
:'''Princess Celestia''': You think I ''like'' that kind of pressure?! Being responsible for every little thing in Equestria ''and'' you?! What I'd like is a [booming] ''sister I can depend on!''
:'''Princess Luna''': [booming] ''You mean boss around!''
:'''Princess Celestia''': [booming] ''Calm down, Luna!''
:'''Princess Luna''': No! And don't you ''dare'' use your Canterlot Voice on me! I think this adventure would be better if I did it by myself!
:'''Princess Celestia''': ''Fine!'' I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!
:'''Princess Luna''': [tearing up] Guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.

:'''Applejack''': Pinkie! You got those appetizers yet?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Still mashing the guacamole!
:'''Spike''': [yelping]
:'''Rarity''': So we're just going to have to do with sequins!
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!
:[swans squawking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And we're nowhere near ready!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How does Celestia and Luna rule a kingdom ''and'' get all this done by themselves every year?!
:'''Fancy Pants''': [laughs] Oh, how droll.
:'''Spike''': Uh, what's the funny part exactly?
:'''Fancy Pants''': The princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They don't?
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, goodness, no. That's what the gala planning committees are for. Nopony could handle all this. [sips] Are those... sequins?
:'''Rarity''': Still rude.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! New plan, everypony! We're going to delegate!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [to Upper Crust] You! You're on food duty!
:'''Rarity''': [to Jet Set] I need gemstones! And purple satin!
:'''Fluttershy''': [to Fleur de Lis] Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala! Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.
:'''Applejack''': Uh... Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
:[stomping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm delegating!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So ''this'' is how you rule Equestria!

:'''Princess Luna''': [slurping, sighs] Things are so much more relaxing without my bossy sister.
:[ponies laughing]

:'''Princess Celestia''': Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway? [whinnies]

:'''Princess Luna''': [groans]
:'''"Nurse Sweetheart"''': Honestly, princess, didn't you wear any sunblock?
:'''Princess Luna''': That's a thing? [sighs] Celestia would've warned me. If she were here.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, was it two left turns and a right, or two right turns and a left?
:[whoosh!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Luna always handled directions.
:[twig snaps]
:[chicken clucks]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [shakily] And scared away the chickens!

:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh! Heh. I thought climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro was on ''my'' list.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm not copying you! I just wanted to watch the sunrise.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ah. I'm, uh, here for the moonset.
:[beat]
:'''Princess Celestia''': So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh, amazing! Yeah. Uh, f-fantastic. Best ever, really.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.
:'''Princess Luna''': You... You can walk with me. You know, i-if you want, I mean.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]

:'''Princess Luna''': This is so beautiful. It must be amazing in the sunlight.
:'''Princess Celestia''': The night's pretty special, too.
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': Lucky star!
:'''Princess Luna''': You taught me to look for those when I was a filly.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.
:'''Princess Luna''': You know, being with your sister all the time is hard, but being without her? It's even harder.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I ''do'' know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.
:'''Princess Luna''': Not even your zip line?
:[poof!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Not even my zip line.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm sorry I said those things before. Sometimes it's just tough being the little sister.
:'''Princess Celestia''': It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.
:'''Princess Luna''': [gasps] The sun and the moon together? At the same time?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, where have I seen ''that'' before?
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laugh]
:[long pause]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?
:'''Princess Luna''': We should probably go help her.

:'''Spike''': Okay, okay! I think I got it! Sunburst says we just need to reset the amulet with this! Turn the screw on the back—
:[cranking]
:[sproing!]
:'''Spike''': ...and no more than one half turn.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers] Does anypony have some tape?!
