:[knocking on door]
:[pounding on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Mail Pony''': [clears throat] Morning, Sunburst.
:'''Sunburst''': What? Oh! Hi! [chuckles nervously] You know, no matter how many times I read it, ''Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical Arcana'' never gets boring.
:'''Mail Pony''': If you say so. I've got another letter for you. From Sire's Hollow.
:'''Sunburst''': Mm-hmm. Sure thing.
:[door closes]
:'''Mail Pony''': [groans]
:[thud]
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Sunburst''': What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen—?
:[thud]
:'''Sunburst''': Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Sunburst''': Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? ''I'm'' called for a friendship mission?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.
:'''Spike''': If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've been on ''one'', Spike.
:'''Spike''': And that's my fair share.
:[door opens]
:'''Sunburst''': Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [depressed] Yeah... Great...
:'''Sunburst''': Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:'''Sunburst''': I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about ''where''.
:'''Sunburst''': Sire's Hollow?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yep. Home.
:'''Sunburst''': [deflated] Oh. Great.
:'''Spike''': You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Sunburst''': [groans]

:[train chugging]
:[indistinct conversations]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] It's not that I don't ''want'' to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal.
:'''Sunburst''': Huh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. I'm a horrible daughter.
:'''Sunburst''': N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Sunburst''': I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] "You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.
:'''Sunburst''': Do you really think that will work?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nope!
:[brakes hissing]
:[train whistle]
:[train chugging]
:'''Sunburst''': [sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le—
:[thud]
:'''Sunburst''': Augh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Where did ''that'' come from?
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Essence?
:'''Sunburst''': Essence of what?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': You tell me.
:[spritz]
:'''Sunburst''': [coughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What is it?
:'''Sunburst''': Uh... chocolate maybe?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Not chocolate maybe. Chocolate definitely! And all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks.
:'''Sunburst''': Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': I don't know what it ''used to be''. The Sire's Hollow Development Committee determined what it ''is''.
:'''Sunburst''': The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': You can get a fruit smoothie two doors down.
:'''Sunburst''': All the shops are different. Everything's changed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not everything. ''That's'' the same as it ever was.
:[door opens]
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Sorry. Our bookstore's been declared a site of historical significance by the Sire's Hollow Preservation Society.
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': You'll have to experience the books from here. That's why windows are see-through.
:[door slams]
:'''Sunburst''': What?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Preservation Society? What is happening around here?
:'''Firelight''': I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?
:'''Firelight''': Oh, just a father wanting to preserve our town's rich history for his little pumpky-wumpkin! [chuckles]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad, you promised no "pumpky-wumpkin"'s in public!
:'''Sunburst''': [stifled laughter]
:'''Firelight''': [whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks.
:[smack!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's exactly what I told him! I said, "Firelight, you're crazy!"
:'''Sunburst''': Mom?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst – a clear plan for the future.
:[snip!]
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!
:'''Firelight''': Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!
:'''Stellar Flare''': And ''I'm'' not gonna let you turn it into a museum!
:'''Firelight''' and '''Stellar Flare''': [growling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?
:'''Sunburst''': Like having a friendship problem?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Oh, there's no problem.
:'''Firelight''': Because there ''is'' no friendship!
:'''Sunburst''': Well, the good news is we know why we're here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [huffs]

:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it.
:'''Stellar Flare''': You mean ''your'' success depends on ''us''?
:'''Sunburst''': Uh...
:'''Firelight''': And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um...
:'''Stellar Flare''': Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable.
:'''Firelight''': Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [sighs]

:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So we can't hold the books?
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': [laughing] No!
:'''Sunburst''': Can ''you'' hold the books?
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': No.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So nopony can ''read'' the books?
:'''Firelight''': [chuckles] Isn't she adorable? [chuckles]

:[gate clanking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!

:'''"Ever Essence"''': You can call them... mm... "smells". But I call them essence!
:[spritz]
:'''Sunburst''': [coughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sniffs] Fruity.
:'''Sunburst''': Too bad there's nowhere to get ''actual'' fruit.
:'''Stellar Flare''': In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [slurping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [coughing]

:[thud]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': One hundred percent ancient pony grains! Just like the town founders ate! Hope you like crust!
:[crunch, thud]

:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Okay, it's annoying. I get it.

:'''Firelight''': Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.
:[crash!]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [groans] Oh, no.
:'''Stellar Flare''': And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
:'''Firelight''': Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions.
:[smack!]
:'''Sunburst''': That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow.
:'''Firelight''': Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. ''I'' was.
:'''Stellar Flare''': How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
:'''Sunburst''': Mom! She doesn't—! It-It's not—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Use your words, Sunburst.
:'''Sunburst''': [angry groan]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.
:'''Stellar Flare''': So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit.
:'''Firelight''': So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!
:[guitar riff]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!
:'''Firelight''': Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two.
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess that makes sense...
:'''Firelight''' and '''Stellar Flare''': [chuckling]
:'''Stellar Flare''': I already have some ideas!
:'''Firelight''': Me, too!
:'''Sunburst''': I think I liked it better when they were fighting.

:[chalk tapping]
:'''Firelight''': Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present.
:'''Firelight''': Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [growling]

:'''Stellar Flare''': Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do.
:'''Sunburst''': Make a plan?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Already got one! Step one – interview the suspects. Step two – use your talents to solve the issue. Step three – get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!
:'''Sunburst''': Mom! It does not work like that!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Uh-huh.
:[beat]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [clears throat]
:'''"Ever Essence"''': [poorly acted] Oh! Thank goodness you are here! These two ponies refuse to use my essences.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Maybe because we don't like to cover our natural scent!
:'''Stellar Flare''': [clears throat irritably]
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Ugh.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Ugh.
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': [sighs] [poorly acted] And she refuses to buy our books.
:'''"Ever Essence"''', '''"Raspberry Latte"''', and '''"Minty Mocha"''': [poorly acted] Surely this is a friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': Ugh! It needs to be a ''real'' friendship problem! You can't just make one up! [angry groan]
:'''Stellar Flare''': This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!

:'''Firelight''': Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whew! What are ''you'' doing?
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're "strangers". I'm a grown mare!
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it.
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': Maybe you two should start looking for it on your own? [crunching]

:[lamp clicks]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private.
:'''Sunburst''': [whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.
:'''"Ever Essence"''': [whispering] Got it. Just one question. Why are we whispering?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': They're avoiding their parents.
:'''"Ever Essence"''', '''"Raspberry Latte"''', and '''"Minty Mocha"''': Ohhhh... [various agreement]
:'''Sunburst''': No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': So you're whispering with all of us in the darkest corner of the shop where nopony can possibly see because you're ''not'' avoiding them?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Sunburst''': Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': No way! This is the antiquities section. Nopony ever comes back here.
:'''Firelight''': There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [groans]

:'''Firelight''': ...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad!
:'''Firelight''': ...was to look back in our town history even farther!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [angry groan]
:'''Stellar Flare''': Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make ''up'' a problem, but what if I start one?
:'''Sunburst''': That's not how this—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': I mean, nopony ever became a success by following ''all'' the rules, right?
:'''Sunburst''': [nickers angrily]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [to Firelight] How are things on your end?
:'''Firelight''': Couldn't be better! New leads and such!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guys...?
:'''Stellar Flare''': We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?
:'''Sunburst''': Guys!
:'''Firelight''': I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Guys!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': ''We don't want your help!''

:'''Stellar Flare''': I'm sorry. You don't want our help?
:'''Firelight''': [chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Because you're driving us crazy!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?
:'''Sunburst''': By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!
:'''Stellar Flare''': [choking up] Well... I'm sorry for trying to help! [crying]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And ''you're'' not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!
:'''Firelight''': Well. I'll let you get to it then.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': It's almost like our relationship with our parents ''is'' the friendship problem.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You don't think that's it, do you?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [clears throat] That's what all of us think.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad?
:'''Firelight''': Hello, ''Ms.'' Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else. [whimpers]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.
:'''Firelight''': So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you.

:'''Stellar Flare''': [sniffs]
:[spritz]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?
:'''Sunburst''': No, I came to apologize.
:'''Stellar Flare''': Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is.
:'''Stellar Flare''': This is a terrible apology.
:'''Sunburst''': Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix.
:'''Sunburst''': But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal.
:'''Firelight''': I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is.
:'''Sunburst''': I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own.
:'''Stellar Flare''': I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school. I thought as long as you had a plan, you'd never feel that way again.
:'''Sunburst''': You don't have to worry, Mom. I need to find my own way. And I definitely don't feel lost anymore.
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [crying] That's so beautiful!

:'''Stellar Flare''': The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.
:'''Sunburst''': [chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while.
:'''Firelight''': You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess so.
:'''Firelight''': So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Absolutely. Mmm.
:'''Sunburst''': And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home.
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you.
:'''Firelight''': Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?
:'''Stellar Flare''': I might have a few plans for that.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [chuckling nervously]
