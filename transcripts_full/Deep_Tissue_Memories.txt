:'''Rainbow Dash''': So all I need to do is get Twilight to talk about a couple of memories?
:'''Spike''': Twilight's so busy, the spa's the only place we could think of where you could "run into her".
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks again for agreeing to this. I know this place isn't exactly your kind of thing.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It sure isn't! But, you know, it's for Twilight, so I'm willing to suffer through anything.
:[door opens]
:'''Lotus Blossom''': Ah, Rainbow Dash! So good to see you again!
:'''Aloe''': Would you like your usual suite of treatments?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs nervously]

:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Lotus Blossom''': [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! It has always been such a pleasure to serve the Princess of Friendship, but now you will be the ruler of all Equestria!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And getting ready for the coronation is pretty hectic. I need some time for myself. Becoming a ruler is exhausting.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Tell me about it! I choreographed a whole routine for the coronation and led the Wonderbolts through it today. It really took it out of me. I can't imagine leading everypony in Equestria.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, Rainbow Dash. I didn't realize you came to the spa after practice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. All the time! Y-You know, for... for the deep tissue sports massage. It really helps with the sore muscles and flexibility. [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] Well, if you're here, I believe it.
:[pages flipping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So when do you think you realized just how athletic I was?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, the first moment we met.

:'''Spike''': Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?
:[whack]
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nng.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sheepish laughter] Uh, 'scuse me? [more sheepish laughter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nnnn.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughter] Lemme help you.
:[rushing water]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [more sheepish laughter] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no. Don't thank me. You're quite welcome. [bursts out laughing]
:'''Spike''': [bursts out laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The one and only. Why, you heard of me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I ''heard'' you were supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the Princess sent me to check on the weather.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Practicing for what?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''The'' Wonderbolts?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yep!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The most talented flyers in ''all'' of Equestria?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's them!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Prove it.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yup. [sighs] I've been a sporty pony my whoooole life. So I have to come to the spa a lot because, um... sports!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Come on, Dash. You don't have to pretend you don't like frilly spa treatments. Everypony knows you're an athlete, but it's not exactly a secret you like to be pampered, too.

:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Rainbow Dash! What are ''you'' doing here?!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': [giggle]
:'''Applejack''': Yeah. I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:[robe and slippers thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, they're totally not. At least, not the froufrou kind.
:'''Rarity''': Ah.
:'''Applejack''': Huh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day. I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage.
:'''"Lavender Essence"''': Ah, Miss Dash, I am so sorry, but we are running just a tad behind, and we are not quite ready to start your pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure just yet.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh! [chuckles nervously] I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for.
:'''"Lavender Essence"''': But they are your usual.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And it seems like you're really busy today anyway! I'll just come back tomorrow. [to Rarity and Applejack] Uh, see you two later! Have fun! [to Lavender Essence, whispered] But put me down for the same thing.
:[whoosh]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': So, Applejack and Rarity told you about that, huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And there's nothing wrong with it. In fact, you should enjoy your indulgent hooficure.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I suppose it's okay to like different kinds of things.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly. I'm not ''only'' a princess, and you're not ''only'' an athlete. Think of all the non-sports things you're into.

:'''Doctor Horse''': Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on? Why are you stealing slippers?
:'''Screwy''': [barking]
:'''Night Watch''': Hey, get back to the hospital!
:'''Applejack''': What's all the ruckus?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's going on, Rainbow Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] I'm an egghead.
:'''Rarity''': Pardon?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': —'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You got me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Good''? Try ''awesomely amazing''. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.
:'''Applejack''': There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fracas!
:'''Applejack''': ...causin' a ''fracas'' just because you like to read.

:'''Rarity''': Ooo. [sniffs] [sneezing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [laugh]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Aaa-choooo''!

:[liquid pouring]
:[bubbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm?
:[poof!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [laugh]

:'''Applejack''': [gasp] Land sakes!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckle]
:[water splash]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't know...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Liking a bit of pampering doesn't make you any less of an athlete or anything else.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're right. What do you say we do hooficures and get pampered together?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks, but I've been looking forward to a little alone time to decompress, and the Ponyville Day Spa has just the thing. Maybe next time.
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We don't have anywhere near enough memories for your section of the book!
:'''Spike''': Sorry, Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]

:[water flowing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You were right!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This decompression thing is great!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It is pretty relaxing. Or it was.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yup. But you know what really gets me relaxed? Thinking about times when I was totally awesome!

:[whooshing]
:'''Gilda''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [laughing]

:[whooshing]
:[stopwatch ticking]
:'''Applejack''': [chewing]
:'''Official''': Ponyville qualifies!
:[crowd cheering]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow, no!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Get! Out! [smack]
:'''Razer''': [sneezes]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe that's relaxing for you. But for me, it's quieter, emotional moments that really do the trick. Can you think of any of those?

:'''Rarity''': The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know what we ''can'' do.
:'''Applejack''': Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [despondently] Whatever...
:'''Rarity''': Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...! [hushed] A ''party pooper''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm ''fine''.
:'''Fluttershy''': Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be ''pet-less''.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sobbing]
:'''Rarity''': Whatever did you do that for?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [more sobbing]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hmm... I mean, that's emotional, sure, but how is it relaxing? No offense. Quiet moments are great, but not as great as being epic!

:'''Rarity''': [panting] Look upon me, Equestria, for I... am... Rarity!
:[crowd oohs]
:'''Rarity''': Uh-oh. [screams]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Misty Fly''': Ooh!
:'''Soarin''': Aah!
:'''Spitfire''': Uuh!
:'''Rarity''': [continues screaming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming!
:'''Rarity''': [more screaming]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I can't look!
:'''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Applejack''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': ''A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! Wooo!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa.
:[crowd cheering]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, where are you going? I can think of a ton more epic relaxing moments!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sure you can, but right now I think I need to relax in my own quiet way.
:'''Spike''': We still need a few more. What are the chances you can get Twilight to remember stuff in her own quiet way?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh!
:[splash]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow. I guess you don't realize how much tension you hold in your flank. Ooh. Oh, yeah. This is exactly what I needed. I love Rainbow Dash, but sometimes she can be a little much.

:[whooshing]
:[screeching]
:'''Scootaloo''': I hope this works.
:[thwack]
:[crowd cheering]
:[storm cloud crackling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yelps]
:[storm cloud crackling]
:[leaves being dislodged]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [multiple yelps]
:'''Crowd''': [gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts, screams]
:[crash]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts, screams]
:[lightning]
:[downed fighter plane engine noise]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hope I'm not too late. [scoffs] I dunno what took that pony so long.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [screams]
:[splat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was amazing!
:'''Spitfire''': Way to go, Rainbow Crash.

:[polka music]
:[skunk sprays]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Gotcha!

:[music continues]
:'''Spike''': [blows fire]
:[thunk]
:'''Spike''': [blows fire]
:[thunk]
:'''Spike''': [blows fire]
:[thunk]
:'''Spike''': [blows fire]
:[thunk]
:'''Spike''': [blows fire]
:[thunk]

:[loud thud]
:[sloop]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Gotcha!

:[clang!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Gotcha!

:[cracking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! Ow! Uh... maybe not quite so hard. [sighs] That's better. Dash might be a hoofful sometimes, but she's the most loyal friend in Equestria.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, what were you gonna do with them ''before''?
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward.
:[hoofbeats]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is that Rainbow Dash... walking?
:'''Spitfire''': [drinking water]
:'''Fleetfoot''': Does... this mean you're feeling better?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place.
:'''Wonderbolts''': [gasps]
:'''Bulk Biceps''', '''Fluttershy''' and '''Derpy''': [gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know now who I should've been loyal to.
:'''Spitfire''': Good choice. Always stick with the winners.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not.
:'''Rest of main cast''' and '''Derpy''': [cheering]

:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': We want you to join us, the ''Shadowbolts''. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yep.
:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': ...swiftest...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes.
:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': ...bravest flyer in all the land.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes. [chuckles] It's all true.
:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': We need... ''you''.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': WOO-HOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': No! It's ''them'' or ''us''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh, no. Rainbow! [muffled] Don't listen to them!
:'''Shadowbolt Leader''': Well?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You... Thank you for the offer, I mean. But I'm afraid I have to say no.
:'''Main cast sans Rainbow''': [cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good job, Rainbow!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's pretty hard not to love a loyal friend like that.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [crying]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you okay?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sobs] I-I'm fine, but... I love you, too! [sniffles] I'm sorry, Twilight, but once we got started reminiscing, I guess I just didn't want to stop.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have had some pretty great times together.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': You gotta really flap 'em hard.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts] Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, maybe not quite that hard.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa! Oof!
:'''Applejack''': Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.
:'''Rarity''': Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm ''never'' gonna be ready to perform my part.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!
:'''Main cast sans Twilight''': [cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Woo-hoo! Whaaaa! Oof! Oof! [coughs] [screams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! That ''was'' a big finish!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': You guys were amazing!
:'''School of Friendship Team''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It was flawless. I can't think of any way that could've been better!
:'''Smolder''': We could have won the game.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] The game was just a sideshow. You guys were the main event!
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm glad to see such good sportsponyship on display. Your cheer squad was an inspiration, Rainbow Dash. I'll have to start one at my school as well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow, Rainbow Dash! It's almost like you were the perfect pony to coach cheer squad after all!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait a second. Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean like how you don't have to care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the ponies who like it? Nope. Don't know what you're talking about.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Nicely done.
:'''All''': [laughing]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, this hasn't exactly been the relaxing spa day I was expecting, but it was pretty great all the same.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And it's good to know I can always fall back on a career as a spa pony if the Wonderbolts don't work out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] I wouldn't go ''that'' far.
:[pages flipping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [forced laughter] Yeah! But... but seriously.
:[zoom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whew!
