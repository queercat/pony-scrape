:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [strained gasping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called ''me'' before!
:'''Spike''': I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [babbles] Actually, it is. Well, it's that and the fact that you're being called to the royal palace! I mean, what in Equestria could be going on there?! You want me to come with you?! No. I shouldn't. The map just called you for a reason, right? Heh. Though maybe it's a mistake. Not because of you! Because it's never called just one of us before. [nervous chuckle]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I also wasn't nervous before, but now...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb.
:'''Spike''': Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.

:'''Princess Celestia''': So the map sent ''you'' to solve a friendship problem?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yes, princess.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?
:'''Princess Luna''': [sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister.

:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Psst! Pssst!
:[music box playing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [quickly] I'm not. I'm still home. It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly "how's it going?" kind of way. So, how's it going?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervously] Noooooo... Heh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't – both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, ''really'' big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music.
:[music box playing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Heh. Comforting, right?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care.
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Good morning, sister! Join us?
:'''Princess Luna''': [sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
:[clatter]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening.
:[knock, knock, knock]
:[door opens]
:'''Guard''': Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chuckling nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good luck, Starlight!
:'''Guard''': [surprised whinny]
:[door closes]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?
:'''Princess Luna''': Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sniffs] That's so thoughtful!
:'''Princess Luna''': I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.
:[door opens]
:'''Fleur De Verre''': And so, then I said, "Touring? More like 'boring'!" [airy laughter]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [laughs] Oh, you really are a card!
:'''Princess Luna''': [sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is ''your'' mission.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I do. But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said "princesses" and "aren't the best" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not much help, am I?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Like I said, I enjoy this part.
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Luna''': [sourly, mouth full] Hi.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I... think I found out what it is.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You two.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Excuse me?
:'''Princess Luna''': [simultaneous] I beg your pardon?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Uh... Y-Yes. It does.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night.
:'''Princess Luna''': I... Well, I... I-It's not the best feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!
:'''Princess Luna''': Like smiling is so hard.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.
:'''Princess Luna''': Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?
:'''Princess Celestia''': And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath...
:'''Princess Luna''': Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!
:'''Princess Celestia''': And yet you know exactly what it's like to be ''me''?! Oh, please!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Enough!''
:[shimmering magic sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': There! Now you'll know exactly what it's like to... be each other. [gulp]

:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps] What have you done?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I... went with my gut?
:'''Princess Luna''': Switch our cutie marks back this instant!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': My apologies, your majesties! But I can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?
:'''Princess Celestia''': [serious] What?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your chance to prove it.
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Good choice! Not that you had one. [chuckles]
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [snort]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm gonna stop talking now.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:[pounding on door]
:'''Guard''': Are you okay in there?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': He's not the only one.
:[drawer opens]
:[drawer slams]

:'''Princess Luna''': As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today.
:[confused murmuring]
:'''Princess Luna''': I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed.
:[nervous murmuring]
:'''Princess Luna''': So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing.
:'''Princess Luna''': [chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be ''that'' easy.

:[happy montage music]

:[scissors clipping]
:[applause]

:'''Princess Luna''': [sniffing]
:[whiffle!]

:'''Princess Luna''': [creaking]
:[camera clicks]

:'''Princess Luna''': "Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser"? But I wasn't unhappy!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um, you ''are'' scowling.
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's when he took the picture!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
:'''Princess Luna''': It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't mean for that to happen!
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. But you can't dwell on that now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks.
:'''Princess Luna''': B-B-But I have to fix this!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help ''these'' ponies. It's what Celestia would do.
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Luna''': [deep breath, shouting] ''Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!''
:[slam]
:'''Delegate Ponies''': No, there are definitely timberwolves!
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury.
:'''Mayor Cream Cheese''': [muffled] The princess will definitely side with me!
:'''Mayor Baltimare''': [simultaneous, muffled] Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese! I'm telling you, Baltimare...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ready for the town hall?
:'''Princess Luna''': [sighs]
:'''Mayor Cream Cheese''' and '''Mayor Baltimare''': [continued arguing]

:'''Mayor Baltimare''': Glad that's settled.
:'''Mayor Cream Cheese''': [chuckles] And it only took three hours.
:'''Mayor Baltimare''': That got heated, didn't it?
:'''Mayor Cream Cheese''': Still on for golf?
:'''Mayor Baltimare''': Oh, absolutely.
:'''Mayor Cream Cheese''': [chuckles]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You made it to the end of the day. Yay?
:'''Princess Luna''': Hmm? Oh. Yes, uh... [yawns] I'm just going to turn in, then. Good light, Starnight. [yawns]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um, uh, she already turned in for the night.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [snoring]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course. Everypony's asleep at night. Heh. Luna works alone... Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle. All I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and protect ponies in their nightmares. My list was three times as long! [chuckles]
:[lightswitches clicking]
:'''Princess Celestia''': All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!
:[vooooom]
:[whimsical music]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [screaming]
:'''Pancakes''': [in Celestia's voice] I care. I care. I care. [distorted] ''I care.''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [screaming] Ugh! No!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is big! Like, ''really'' big!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [yelping]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [panting] Going with my gut was the wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other, then—!
:'''Nightmare Moon''': Then I am back! [laughing evilly]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.
:'''Daybreaker''': Yes! But can you handle... ''me''?! [laughing evilly]

:'''Daybreaker''': [laughing evilly]
:'''Princess Celestia''': This can't be!
:'''Daybreaker''': If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you can absolutely turn into me — Daybreaker! The better, prettier, and more powerful version of you!
:'''Princess Celestia''': No! I'll never turn into you!
:'''Daybreaker''': Deep inside, you know how powerful you are. You don't need Luna.
:'''Princess Celestia''': That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!
:'''Daybreaker''': [laughs] Oh, please! You don't need anypony! You can do whatever you want. And all you have to do is get rid of anypony who stands in your way!
:[magic zap]
:'''Daybreaker''': I never should've banished you to the moon! I should've destroyed you!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon — Equestria needs both of you!
:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Without balance, there's no harmony!
:[boom!]
:'''Nightmare Moon''': [growls]
:'''Daybreaker''': Who needs balance when you can have it all?! [laughs]
:[magic zap]
:'''Daybreaker''': Ugh!
:'''Nightmare Moon''': You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on ''smiling'' me to smithereens!
:'''Princess Celestia''': ''Enough!''
:'''Daybreaker''': [laughs] I told you I was more powerful than you!
:[magic humming]
:'''Daybreaker''': Ugh. So much black. We get it. You're sad. You could really use some... ''sun!''
:[flames roaring]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:[shimmering magic sounds]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [grunting]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!

:'''Dream Ponies''': [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
:'''Dream Pony''': Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?
:'''Princess Luna''': [through teeth gaps] I don't...!
:[teeth clattering]
:'''Princess Luna''': I mean, I do!
:'''Dream Ponies''': [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
:'''Princess Luna''': Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Princess Luna''': [speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen ''this'' before.
:'''Princess Celestia''': It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!
:'''Princess Luna''': If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche.
:'''Princess Celestia''': But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
:'''Princess Luna''': I have ''your'' magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!
:'''Princess Luna''': And that pony is ''you''. I walked a day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that.
:'''Daybreaker''': [laughing maniacally]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Nightmare Moon''': [screams] Ugh!
:'''Daybreaker''': [laughing maniacally]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Don't do this to each other!
:'''Princess Luna''': In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do.
:[magic zaps]
:'''Daybreaker''': You can't destroy me! I'm everything you want to be!
:'''Princess Celestia''': No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist ''again!''
:'''Daybreaker''': [groans]
:[pop!]
:'''Princess Luna''': You did it!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.
:'''Princess Luna''': So, um, did you talk to yourself?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Um, a little.
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?
:[vooooom]

:'''Princess Luna''': Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.
:'''Princess Luna''': [laughs] I know that face! They're not. I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job. But you don't have to do it for me.
:'''Princess Celestia''': In that case, they are terrible!
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laughing]
:'''Princess Luna''': I know!
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister.
:'''Princess Luna''': I love you too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So... this ''was'' real. [yawns] Or... was it ''not'' real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.
:'''Princess Luna''': The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.
:'''Princess Celestia''': It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
:[shimmering magic sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wait. I'm not doing this.
:[cutie mark ringing]
:'''Princess Celestia''': I believe that one means your mission is complete.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [quickly] I already know! I mean, I don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you! ''Tell me everything!'' Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a – ahem – timberwolf issue you need to address.
:'''Princess Celestia''': W-What?
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh! Look! There's the sun! Time for me to turn in!
