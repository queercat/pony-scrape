:[music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [singsongy] Road trip! [normal] Okay, not technically a road trip, because we're taking that. Uh-huh. Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Beat ya to the balloon!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! I'm gonna beat ''you!''
:[zip!]
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[both grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm gonna beat ''you!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No, ''I'm'' gonna— [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eep!
:'''Applejack''': Howdy.
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] Okay, I was fourth.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah? Well, ''I'' was fifth! [giggles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's not even—!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, yeah!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But I beat you!
:'''Applejack''': Y'all are ''both'' still late! We gotta shove off soon, or we'll miss the tailwind.
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't worry. We wouldn't have left without you.
:'''Rarity''': Well, that goes without saying, darling. After all, Rainbow Dash is the guest of honor at the Rainbow Festival.
:[whoosh!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha-ha!
:'''Fluttershy''': Has anypony seen Twilight? It's not like her to be late for an adventure.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm coming, I'm coming! [panting]
:'''Spike''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting] Sorry. I just had to pack up a few books and papers to grade.
:'''Spike''': [straining] And by "few", she means "slightly less than I'm able to lift"! [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. You're bringing ''work'' to a ''festival''?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! It's supposed to be a nonstop fun-o-rama party!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': Yeah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Grading papers ''is'' fun. It's relaxing and rewarding and—
:'''Applejack''': Too much to talk about right now. [grunts]
:[flame igniting]
:'''Spike''': [grunts, sighs]
:'''Applejack''': Let 'er loose, Spike!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Keep an eye on things for me, and feel free to file those class assignments while I'm gone.
:'''Spike''': It's my top priority. Have fun, everypony!
:[music, music stops]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, why aren't we going anywhere?
:'''Applejack''': Hmm. The basket's too heavy.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity?
:'''Rarity''': How dare you! I brought the itsy-est valise!
:'''Applejack''': Sorry to do this, Twilight, but... [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My papers!
:[whistling]
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [grunts] Ugh.
:'''Applejack''': They'll keep 'til we get back.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Miss us!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Bye-bye!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Keep an eye on things!
:'''Spike''': See ya! And remember, whatever happens at the Rainbow Festival, I wanna hear all about it when you get back!
:[Mane Six giving various goodbyes]

:[traveling music]
:[birds chirping]

:'''Rarity''': Did somepony mention something about a spa in... where is it we're going again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hope Hollow. Or, as I like to call it...
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Rainbow Dash Fan Central"!
:'''Applejack''': Ugh. You're gonna be like this the whole trip, ain't ya?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You know it! I mean, look at this letter! They ''love'' me there!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Dear Rainbow Dash, thank you for agreeing to be our guest at this year's famous Hope Hollow Rainbow Festival. The many members of your fan club..."
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [continues reading] "...are looking forward to your visit. You and your friends will be staying at our famous luxury Rainbow Resort and Spa, where your every whim will be catered to."
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I accept that challenge. I have so many whims.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, look. There's a famous butterfly garden, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm. Y'know, it's strange that we never heard of this festival before, especially since everything in the town is so well-known.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "At this year's festival, you can eat treats at the traditional Rainbow Bakery Booth, sing your favorite rainbow-themed songs at the karaoke competition..."
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Bakery ''and'' karaoke?! It's like they see into my soul!
:'''Applejack''': [reading] "...and try our famous rainbow trout catch-and-release activity." Huh. Now that sounds right up my river.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Plus, we get to watch the mayor give Rainbow Dash an award! I call dibs on the cheering section! [squeals]
:[party cannon]
:'''Rarity''': An award for what, exactly?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I 'unno. Showing up? General coolness? [laughs] All of the above?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we're so glad you invited us along.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! It's gonna be one long party, which starts... now!
::A hundred bottles of pop on the wall
::A hundred bottles of pop
:'''[Mane Six]'''
::Take one down, pass it around
::Ninety-nine bottles of pop on the wall

::Ninety-nine bottles of pop on the wall
::Ninety-nine bottles of pop... [fades out]

:'''[Pinkie Pie]'''
::Two bottles of pop on the wall
::Two bottles of pop
::Take it down, pass it around
::One bottle of pop on the wall

:And a-one more time!

::A hundred bottles of pop on the wall
:[muffled speaking] Six times too many?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh. Shouldn't we be there by now?
:'''Applejack''': Huh. I thought so, too. Maybe we should've turned left at that last cloud instead o' right.
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh, it's getting darker by the minute.
:'''Rarity''': I can't see ''anything!'' Oh.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I spy with my little eye... a rainbow!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Great. We're playing ''that'' game now?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, I really ''do'' spy a rainbow!
:'''Mane Six''': [awed reactions]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow! That's the biggest rainbow I've ever seen.
:'''Rarity''': [panicked] And we're headed right for it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't worry. We'll pass right through it. Rainbows aren't solid.
:[thud]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasping]
:'''Applejack''': Tell that to the rainbow.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think that's a rainbow. It's a rainbow ''billboard''!
:[creaking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hang on, everypony!
:[air escaping]
:'''Mane Six''': [screaming]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blowing]
:'''Rarity''': ''I don't think that working!''
:'''Applejack''': ''We're gonna craaaaash!''
:'''Mane Six''': [resume screaming]

:'''Mane Six''': [screaming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, let's get everypony out!
:[music]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Mane Six''': [sighing]
:[crash]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [coughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Phew! Thanks, y'all. That basket could've been us.
:'''Fluttershy''': Where... are we?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh! [reading sign] "Welcome to Hope Hollow: Home of the Famous..."
:[crash]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [resumes reading] "...Rainbow Festival"!
:'''Rarity''': We've arrived, and there's nopony here to greet us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good thing, too. The guest of honor and her friends just destroyed the town sign.
:'''Fluttershy''': Rainbow Dash, did your letter say where our hotel is?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... [reading] "The middle of town".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm... Doesn't really help much when you don't know where the middle is. Let's start looking.
:[music]

:[spooky music]
:[sign creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Funny. You'd think a big luxury resort would be sorta, well... easier to spot.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! It seems like the whole town's shut down.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, look. ''There's'' somepony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. Hello!
:'''Petunia Petals''': [gasps] Oh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you can help us. We're here for the Rainbow Festival.
:'''Petunia Petals''': [Minnesota accent] Oh, uh, "Rainbow Festival"?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, you know, the one where ''I'm'' the guest of honor? [laughs] Yeah!
:'''Petunia Petals''': Oh, for cryin' in the mud, what's Sunny done now?
:'''Applejack''': Excuse me?
:'''Petunia Petals''': I mean, um, you'd best talk to Mayor Skies about that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great! And where would we find him?
:'''Petunia Petals''': City hall. Uh, but it's closed 'til tomorrow, don'tcha know? Is there somethin' ''I'' can help ya with?
:'''Rarity''': Uh, yes, please. Could you direct us to the Hope Hollow Luxury Resort?
:'''Petunia Petals''': [giggles]
:[beat]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Oh! Oh, you mean the hotel?
:'''Mane Six''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Petunia Petals''': That's easy. There's only one in town.
:'''Applejack''': Could you, uh, give us directions?
:'''Petunia Petals''': No need. You're there.
:[doors open]
:'''Petunia Petals''': I mean here!
:[music]
:[lights click]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Hotel Hope, also known as the Town Information Center and Library! My name's Petunia Petals, by the way. Helloooo!
:[zip!]
:'''Petunia Petals''': I'm the librarian here and the information guide...
:[ding!]
:'''Petunia Petals''': ...and the hotel manager, historian, chef, portrait painter—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, I'm Rainbow Dash, and this is everypony.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Hello.
:'''Applejack''': Howdy.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Well, hello, everypony! You just wait one hoofshake, and I'll take ya to the room.
:'''Rarity''': ''The'' room?
:'''Petunia Petals''': There's only one. Makes it easier to find! [chuckles]

:[music]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Here it is! The Royal Suite!
:[door opens]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[lights flickering]
:'''Rarity''': [gasping dramatically] How rustic and charming.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Isn't it just?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I couldn't help noticing there are only three beds.
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, four.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Oh, there's a pop-out, too! [grunts] It can be a little tricky.
:[thud]
:'''Petunia Petals''': There she is. Sleeps two. You'll be all fresh and ready to see the mayor in the mornin'.
:[door opens]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Sleep tight.
:[door closes]
:[shatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Did anypony notice anything strange about Petunia?
:'''Rarity''': Other than that she just called this place "the Royal Suite"?
:'''Applejack''': Hard to tell in this light, but she looked a little gray, didn't she?
:'''Rarity''': Probably from all the dust up here. [blows, coughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, this room's not so bad. All it needs is some balloons, streamers... [humming] And... a piñata! Good thing I brought some!
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh? And look. It comes with a cute little spider. Hello, spider.
:[spider squeaks]
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Sorry, everypony. I didn't know what I was getting you into.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aw. The most important thing is we're all together.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah. As long as we have beds to sleep in, we're set.
:[fwip!]
:'''Applejack''': Whoa! Ugh.

:[music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well... [yawns] ...it wasn't the ''worst'' night of sleep ever.
:'''Rarity''': But definitely in the top three... or would that be the ''bottom'' three?
:[ponies murmuring]
:'''Fluttershy''': Why is everypony looking at us?
:'''Applejack''': Maybe they recognize Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or Princess Twilight. But probably me.
:'''Rarity''': No. I think they're staring because we're the only part of this town that isn't... gray.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whadaya mean?
:'''Rarity''': Look around. All the colors here are ''gone!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's so strange. It's just like I noticed about Petunia last night. Everything's mostly gray.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Oh! Hellooo!
:'''Applejack''': Except the stuff that's grayer.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my. I knew something was different, but—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is so weird!
:'''Man Pony''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': And the way they're gawking at us, it appears they think ''we're'' the odd ones.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe they don't even notice. It might be rude to mention it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wonder what caused this.
:'''Applejack''': We can ask the mayor.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, if we ever ''find'' him.
:[ponies whispering]

:'''Barley Barrel''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [grunting]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Quit shoving!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Shoving? These are pro-level moves I'm doing, sis. Yeah— Ohhh!
:'''Barley Barrel''': C'mon! Let go!
:'''Barley Barrel''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [gasp, grunt, gasp again]
:[angelic choir]
:[beat]
:[zip!]
:'''Barley Barrel''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [whispering indistinctly]
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': [upper-class accent] Don't pout, dear. It'll wrinkle your withers.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': [upper-class accent] I'm not pouting, sweetums, but I am hurt by your comment. I thought the pie I baked was quite tasty.
:'''Mrs Hoofington''': I didn't say it wasn't.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': You didn't say it ''was''.
:'''Mr.''' and '''Mrs. Hoofington''': Oh!
:'''Moody Root''': Watch where you're goin'! You don't own the sidewalk, ya know?!
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Well, I never!
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Ugh.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Huh?
:'''Mr.''' and '''Mrs. Hoofington''': Oh!
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?

:[crane cranking]
:'''Applejack''': Well, look at that. Somepony's fixin' up our balloon.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [Minnesota accent] Oh, goodness. This is unfortunate. Bad with a side of terribly awful. [to Mane Six] Excuse me. Sorry.
:'''Mane Six''': [angry reactions]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [sighs] Eh? Ohhh! [laughs] Well, stuff me in an olive and call me a pimento! It's ''the'' Rainbow Dash! Ya made it! Uh, it is.. you, isn't it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pretty sure, yeah.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, thank Celestia! I saw the balloon, thought the worst, and... Well, you're here, all o' ya! Welcome to the Hope Hollow Annual Rainbow Festival!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm Twilight Sparkle, and you must be...
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Sunny Skies, the mayor o' this lovely town, and pleased as a poplar tree to meetcha!
:'''Fluttershy''': We're very sorry about your rainbow billboard, Mr. Mayor. It was dark and—
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, don't give it a second thought. That old thing needed repair anyway. I haven't used it since... uh... well, never mind. Uh, a-a-anyway, once your balloon's fixed up, Torque can take care of the billboard. Everypony, meet Torque Wrench, our town handypony. She offered to repair your balloon for ya.
:'''Torque Wrench''': He volunteered me.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': She'll have it fixed in a jiffy.
:'''Torque Wrench''': If, by "jiffy", ya mean "this will take all day".
:[torch flame]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Sooo ya got in last night. I wish I'd known. I would've been here to greetcha. Uh, where'd y'all stay?
:'''Rarity''': At the "Luxury Hotel".
:'''Applejack''': Petunia Petals let us in.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, well, of course she did. She's somethin', I'll tell you what. I'd be lost without her. I mean, uh, th-the town would be.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mayor, I hope you don't mind my asking, but is there a reason your town is... faded?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh! Heh. Ya spotted that, did ya? Well, it's a... long story. Uh, why don't I show you the town highlights first?
:'''Mane Six''': [confused reactions]

:[plop]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Here's our famous outdoor spa with the all-natural mud bath. Pretty, huh?
:[plop]
:'''Rarity''': Ah! Ugh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we could see some of the Rainbow Festival activities from the brochure.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': O' course! The bakery booth is there...
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Or... will be. We're... still settin' up, but we gotta lotta great things planned.
:'''Fluttershy''': And... the butterfly garden?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, that's right over here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Applejack''': Huh.
:[paper falling]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, uh, lemme fix that.
:'''Fluttershy''': So none of the butterflies are actually...
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Real? Oh, no. Uh, what with the flowers not havin' color and all, the butterflies don't really come around much anymore.
:'''Applejack''': I'm almost afraid to ask, but the brochure mentioned fishin'?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Fishin'? Oh, I'm not sure whatcha mean.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Our famous rainbow trout"?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, yah, sure! Uh, well, uh, you don't fish for him exactly. You just kinda, uh, talk to him. Uh, he's right over, uh... [sighs] That's funny. Where'd our trout go?
:'''Trout Pony''': Oh, Mr. Mayor! Uh, just, uh, taking my lunch now, okay? [slurp!]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [chuckles nervously]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, so no big deal – well, actually, okay, yes, kind of a big deal – but the brochure also mentioned a karaoke contest? [blink, blink]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Right here!
:[sign falls]
:[thud]
:[microphone feedback]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': The trout doubles on harmonica.
:'''Trout Pony''': [toots harmonica]
:'''Fluttershy''': How... multitalented of him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Good thing I bring my ''own'' karaoke party!
::With me wherever I go
::Whoa, whoa-oh!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Well, uh... that's the big tour. [hums]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mayor Skies.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Eh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't understand. Your Rainbow Festival isn't quite as you described.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And the resort hotel wasn't what it was cracked up to be either.
:'''Applejack''': 'Cept for all the cracks.
:'''Rarity''': ''None'' of these things are as pictured in your brochure.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Well, maybe I exaggerated a little, but I-I'd intended on havin' everythin' ready. It's just kinda hard gettin' anypony excited about ''any''thin' in this town anymore! Ugh. I didn't think ya'd come if ya knew the truth.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The truth?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh... There ''is'' no Rainbow Festival!
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': No Rainbow Festival?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No fan club?!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Believe me, I didn't mean to—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Bring us here for nothing?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Think of all the papers I could be grading!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': If ya just let me—
:'''Rarity''': We should just leave this very moment!
:'''Applejack''': Balloon's not fixed yet.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe we should let the mayor explain.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [clears throat] Uh, guess I should start at the beginnin'. A long time ago, when my Grandpa Skies was mayor, Hope Hollow was different. They used to call this town "The End of the Rainbow", 'cause everything you'd ever want, you could find right here.
{{#lst:The End of the Rainbow|song}}
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [bawls] That is the saddest story-song I've ever heard!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': I tried for a long time to get everypony interested in the Festival again. To remember what it's like to come together as a community and share the fun. But nopony even bothered listenin'. That's why I wrote to ''you'', Rainbow Dash. You were my last hope. I figured if a pony of your stature came to town, it would get everypony excited about puttin' on the Festival again. I mean, "Rainbow"'s even part o' your name!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Mmm, yeah, I can see that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mr. Mayor, what kind of magic did you use on the Rainbow Generator?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, I'm not sure. I didn't know what I was dealin' with. I only wanted to help. But instead, I sucked all the color outta the town. That billboard's one o' the only things that didn't change. To me, it's a reminder of what we ''can'' be. Keeps the "Hope" in "Hope Hollow".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. If I could find out the type of magic you used, I might be able to reverse the spell.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Ya mean, you're gonna stay?
:'''Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Nothin' we like better than a challenge, 'specially when it comes to helpin' ponies.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': You don't know how clam-happy this all makes me! Thank you kindly!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll do whatever we can to bring back your Rainbow Festival.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': I won't fib to ya, it won't be easy. It's gotten so nopony even ''talks'' to each other anymore.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mmm, it might be tough, but we have a little experience bringing ponies together.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yay! This is exactly like planning a party! Only bigger, 'cause it's a ''festival!'' [giggles] Which means more cupcakes! Whoo-hoo! Ooh. Ah! I've got a date with the Bakery Booth! Ha-ha!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggling rhythmically]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um... I'd better go with her.
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm, an overall stylistic look to unify the sentiment of the celebration. That's what this festival needs.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Ya mean like a rainbow?
:'''Rarity''': Yes, darling, yes, yes, but more complex, more thematic, something like— Ooh! something like that! ''Formidable!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The biggest challenge is getting your town interested in a Rainbow Festival when everything's so... gray. I think if we can bring the color back, it'll solve everything.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Yah, I'm with ya there, but—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash, I need your help.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Mr. Mayor, seriously, ''is'' there a fan club?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, you betcha! They're around... somewhere.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh.
:'''Applejack''': Any tools I can borrow, your Honor? I'm gonna spruce up that billboard to let everypony know this here Rainbow Festival's back in business!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh, that's music to my ears! Torque Wrench, let's get our guest tooled up, whadaya say? She's gonna put our rainbow back up.
:'''Torque Wrench''': [sarcastically] Oh, yippee.
:[music]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Heh-heh.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh! Uh, if ya don't mind, I, uh, I have a speech to work on. See ya 'round.
:'''Applejack''': Hmm.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': So... what's your plan?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If magic caused this, maybe magic can solve it.
:[music]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Oh, I was afraid of that. I've never seen any magic like ''this'' before.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. Let me try. I mean, "Rainbow"'s part of my name, right?
:[music]
:[whooshing]
:[boom!]
:[ponies exclaiming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh. Yeah, that's all I got.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Thanks for trying. I guess I need to do more research.
:[whooshing]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Look out!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': No, you look out!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [screaming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [grunt]
:'''Pickle Barrel''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are you okay?
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': Oh!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Why did you zig in front of me like that?
:'''Pickle Barrel''': I didn't zig! ''You'' zigged! I ''zagged!''
:'''Barley Barrel''': That's no excuse for—!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Guys, guys, hold on! It was just an accident.
:'''Pickle Barrel''': An accident that happened in front of ''you''.
:'''Barley Barrel''': Ugh, I'm so embarrassed. All of our lives, we've been wanting to meet you, and—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. So ''you're'' the fan club?
:[doing!]
:'''Barley Barrel''': You've heard of us?
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Barley's the president.
:'''Barley Barrel''': Pickle's the assistant president.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, what do you know? The mayor ''was'' telling the truth about something!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Anyway, you're my brother's favorite Wonderbolt!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': And my sister's favorite Wonderbolt, too!
:'''Barley Barrel''': He knows all your best moves!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': So does she!
:'''Barley Barrel''': We practice all of 'em, every day!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [grunting]
:'''Pickle Barrel''': But we really can't do them. [to Barley] Well, it's true!
:'''Barley Barrel''': [to Pickle] Go ahead. Ask her.
:'''Pickle Barrel''': No, ''you'' ask her.
:'''Barley Barrel''': No, ''you'' ask her!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': No, ''you!''
:'''Barley Barrel''': No, ''you'' do it!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': No, ''you'' do it!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Mmm!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Somepony ask me!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Do you think maybe... you could give us a lesson? Just a tiny one? Show us some of your moves?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. Well, you promise to listen ''and'' work hard ''and'' practice?
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [gasp]
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Yes!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Absolutely, practice!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh, tell you what. If I like what I see, the three of us will put on a show at the Rainbow Festival.
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': Oh!
:'''Barley Barrel''': There's still a Rainbow Festival?
:'''Pickle Barrel''': And we're gonna perform at it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think the whole town should know there's a couple of future Wonderbolts living here. C'mon! We got work to do!
:[whoosh!]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Did you hear that?!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': She called us "future Wonderbolts"!
:[whoosh!]
:[magic sounds]

:'''Applejack''': I think some o' this can be saved, but we'll need some fresh lumber. Uh, Torque, the mayor said maybe you could lend a hoof.
:'''Torque Wrench''': [groans] Him and his crazy schemes. What's ''your'' business in this anyhoo? Hmm?
:'''Applejack''': Well, for ''one'' thing, we're helpin' the mayor. And for ''another'', Granny Smith always says, "You break somethin', you fix it. And any job you do, you should be proud of."
:'''Torque Wrench''': [laughs] Proud of bein' the repairpony? [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': Well, absolutely! It's a pretty rare talent to have. Nice work on that balloon basket, by the way. Reweavin' all that straw is no joke.
:'''Torque Wrench''': Oh. Yah, well, thanks for, well, noticin'.
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:[hammering]
:[magic sounds]

:'''Rarity''': [humming] Hmm? That's one of ''my'' designs! Hello?
:'''Kerfuffle''': [gasps] Whoa, no way! Stack my pancakes! Are you really ''the'' Rarity?!
:'''Rarity''': Uh, it's just "Rarity". Uh, and I-I couldn't help but notice that you've got—
:'''Kerfuffle''': [gasps] I love ya! I love ya so much! Your work, I mean! Your designs, your taste, your eye for beauty!
:'''Rarity''': Well, thank you—
:'''Kerfuffle''': They're the perfect canvas for me to fancy up!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, about that. The— the hat, the— the boa, the scarf, the—
:'''Kerfuffle''' Do ya like 'em?
:'''Rarity''': Very charming.
:'''Kerfuffle''': [gasps] Thank ya! [giggles] Those are Kerfuffle originals! I'm Kerfuffle! Spelled like it sounds, with a double "ffff" for the "fuff"! [gasps] I should really stop talking now.
:'''Rarity''': I do hope you don't mind my asking. But with all this talent, why don't you simply display your ''own'' work instead of adding to others?
:'''Kerfuffle''': [laughs] Oh. Oh, no, I-I couldn't. It's... not good enough by itself.
:'''Rarity''': Hmph, ''au contraire''. Take this shawl. Hoof-dyed, nicely woven, a piece of art by itself. Imagine if you could work in color.
:'''Kerfuffle''': Oh, I do imagine. I mean, that's how I design things. I feel in my heart what the colors are. Like this scarf. This stripe is red, then orange, yellow...
:'''Rarity''': Like a rainbow. How would you like to work with me as the official assistant designer of the Rainbow Festival?
:'''Kerfuffle''': [gasps] Really? Work with you?! I can't believe it! [laughs gleefully] Wait, there's still a Rainbow Festival?
:'''Rarity''': Darling, if we have anything to do with it, not only will there be a festival, it will be the most stylish anypony in this town has ever seen! Now let's get started!
:[magic sounds]

:[music]
:[doors opening]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow...
:[music continues]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Ya like it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I ''love'' it! I just never thought—
:'''Petunia Petals''': That a teeny town like Hope Hollow would have a library this grand? We may be small, but we're well-read. I make sure of it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mayor Sunny was right. You ''are'' something!
:'''Petunia Petals''': Did he really say that? [giggles] Oh, that silly unicorn. Did he say anythin' else? I mean, uh, anyhoo, what can I do you for?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't suppose you have a magic section?
:'''Petunia Petals''': [laughs] "Arcane", "Elemental", or "Theory of"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [squeals]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's see. If fifty cupcakes makes a party, that means for the festival, we need... divide by two, carry the one...
:'''Fluttershy''': More?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Super more! We're gonna need some baking help!
:[sign creaks]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:[crack]
:'''Fluttershy''': It looks like it's closed.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, that's so sad.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': [distantly] We can only use the ones from our yard, lovey.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Oh, darling, stop it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Excuse me. I see you're taking your pie for a walk, and I was wondering—
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': We're not interested. Ugh, it's getting so a pony can't even walk down the street without being terrorized.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] That's not terrorize. This... [babbles]
:'''Mr.''' and '''Mrs. Hoofington''': Aah!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...is terrorize.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So, how would you like to be a part of the official baking team of the Rainbow Festival?
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': There's still a Rainbow Festival?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh. We'll have a booth with cupcakes and pastries and fun, and we're gonna start with this pie! Let the taste test begin! [chomps, gags] Blech! Bleghhht! [gagging] What kind of pie did you say this was s'upposed to be?
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Apricot.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Are you sure? It's kinda... crunchy.
:'''Fluttershy''': Not that there's anything wrong with that.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Well, the apricots are from our very own tree.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': In our very own yard.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Behind our very own house.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah. Maybe we should get a look at this tree.

:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': All right, rookies. Show me what you got.
:'''Barley Barrel''': [whispering, to Pickle] She sounds just like we always imagined she'd sound!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': [whispering, to Barley] Only twenty percent cooler!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well? Aren't you gonna fly or something?
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Yes, sir! I mean, ma'am. Uh...
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [chuckle nervously]
:[music]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Okay? Break!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [groan] Whoa! [grunt, yell]
:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fancy flying is something you have to work up to. Even ''I'' didn't become "Rainbow Dash" in one day.
:'''Barley Barrel''': ''Two'' days?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Everypony's got to learn the basics before they can show off.
:[whoosh]
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': Whoa!
:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You'll get there. But first, let's start with a single flip.
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [gasp]
:[magic sounds]

:'''Fluttershy''': If you don't mind my asking, you don't sound like the other ponies here in town.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Oh, we weren't born here. We're originally from Manehattan.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': But it was so big. All those ponies crammed together, never talking to each other. Ooh.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': We heard Hope Hollow was just the opposite, so we moved here.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': And it was wonderful... uh, for a while.
:'''Fluttershy''': What happened?
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Uh, things changed. Oh! Here. This is the tree.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': This is where the apricots in my pie came from.
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, I'm no expert, but I don't think these are very ripe. Apricots are supposed to be orange.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Well, that's the problem, isn't it? With hardly any colors in this town, one apricot looks like another.
:'''Fluttershy''': What about ''that'' tree? Its apricots are big and juicy.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Oh. We can't use the apricots from that tree.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure ya can! All you gotta do is—
:'''Moody Root''': Hey! Stay away from my tree!
:'''Fluttershy''': W-What was that?
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Just old Moody Root.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': He's made it quite clear he won't share his apricots. He hasn't even said "hello" in ages.
:'''Fluttershy''': Have ''you'' tried saying "hello" to ''him''?
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': What? Well, no, but—
:'''Fluttershy''': Mr. Moody Root, are you there?
:'''Moody Root''': Who wants to know?
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm Fluttershy. Your apricot tree is beautiful. So healthy. You must take very good care of it.
:'''Moody Root''': Well, I try to. Plant food. A good water now and then. Keeps my apricots happy.
:'''Fluttershy''': I bet ''that's'' why you have so many of them. You must always be busy making things. Jam, cobbler, pie...
:'''Moody Root''': Nope, I just eat 'em. Although, pie does sound pretty good.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': What in Equestria is she doing?
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': I haven't the foggiest, dear.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Doing what she does best.
:'''Fluttershy''': Your neighbors were just about to bake some pies. You know them, right? Mr. and Mrs. Hoofington, Mr. Moody Root.
:'''Moody Root''': Um... [clears throat] H-H-Hello, uh...
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Yes. Hello.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Hello, Mr... Root.
:'''Moody Root''': [clears throat]
:'''Fluttershy''': But they're a little short on apricots.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': If only there was some apricots we can use... [clears throat, clears throat more irritably]
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Oh, yes, of course! We'd be happy to bake you a pie.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Two or... three pies even.
:'''Moody Root''': So ya mean if I give ya my apricots...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] What a great idea!
:'''Fluttershy''': Then everypony can share. What do you think, Mr. Moody Root?
:[sloop!]
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Ugh. Oh, well.
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait for it...
:[music building up]
:[gate opens]
:'''Moody Root''': Got a ladder? We can just pick 'em from ''your'' side of the fence!
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Um, yes, of course! Uh, this way!
:[magic sounds]

:[music]
:[pages flipping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A prism curse? An erasure spell? None of these are big enough to make a whole town lose its color on their own! Ugh! Unless...
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [muffled] Oh, for the love o' cheddar!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [muttering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mayor Skies.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Oh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What is all this?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Princess Twilight! Welcome to our town's Rainbow Room. Anything you want ta know about each year's festival from the very beginnin'.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The pictures! They're in color!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Sure are. Oh. Those are from happier times. Back when there still ''was'' a festival. Seems even though ''we'' faded, the memory never did. I come here sometimes for inspiration. I need plenty for this speech I'm writin'. Biggest one of my life. [to Petunia] Oh! Didn't see ya there!
:'''Petunia Petals''': Sunny! I-I didn' know ''you'' were here.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Uh, Uh, j-just leavin'. [chuckles] I-I gotta finish this. W-Well, uh, s-see ya later!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa. The festival was really something, wasn't it?
:'''Petunia Petals''': Used to be wonderful. It brought the whole town together for a long time, and these pictures are from the last festival. You can see it didn't go well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. The mayor's magic in the generator caused the colors to go.
:'''Petunia Petals''': That's what Sunny thinks. He blames himself for it, but I'm still not convinced it was anythin' other than an accident!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's something strange about this. I just can't put my hoof on it. If only the Generator hadn't been destroyed...
:'''Petunia Petals''': Not all of it was.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Petunia Petals''': [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow!
:'''Petunia Petals''': I don't keep it out because I know it hurts th' mayor to see it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mind if I borrow this?

:[music]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [laughs] Great job! It's even better than it was before, don'tcha know?
:[ponies chattering]
:'''Pony #1''': Rainbow Festival?
:'''Pony #2''': Didn't know it was still goin' on.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Sure is! Bigger and better than ever! I hope. Tell all your friends!
:'''Colt''': Can we go, Mama?
:'''Pony #2''': I suppose so. Why not?
:[magic sounds]
:'''Colt''': [gasps, laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mr. Mayor. [grunts] I hope you don't mind, but—
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Where'd ya find ''that?''
:'''Petunia Petals''': I gave it to her, Sunny. She has an idea.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Best idea would just be to throw that thing in the trash heap.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My theory is that the Generator magnifies whatever magic it uses, makes it stronger. So if we could rebuild it and use one of the reversal spells I just read about, it could work to bring color back to the town!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Even if we ''could'' get it workin' again, which is quite a tall order...
:'''Applejack''' Not for a gifted repairpony who I just happen to know.
:'''Torque Wrench''': Let me take a look-see. Yah, I could give 'er a go.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Huh. I don't wanna get my hope up, but... yahoo!
:'''Torque Wrench''': Don't worry. I'll get to work.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Um, how's your speech comin', Sunny? I'd be happy to help you with it if you'd like.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Uh, oh, no, you couldn't. Uh, t-thanks, but, uh, I have to do a little mayor-type business, don'tcha know? But I'll check back in a little bit to see how everythin's goin'.
:[zip!]
:'''Petunia Petals''': Hmmm. He's actin' so peculiar.
:'''Applejack''': From what I've seen of the mayor, how can ya tell exactly when "peculiar" kicks in?

:[music]
:'''Moody Root''': [chomping] Mm-mm-mm-mm! If I'd have known your pie was this good, I'd have given you those apricots ages ago!
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Mr. Hoofington did all the baking.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Mmm, inspired by you, Snookums. Mwah.
:'''Moody Root''': Say, the whole town should know about this here pie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, don't worry. They will. We're gonna give it away at the Rainbow Festival!
:'''Moody Root''': Wait, what? There's still a Rainbow Festival?
:'''Fluttershy''': Uh-huh.
:'''Moody Root''': [laughs]
:[magic sounds]

:[ding]
:'''Torque Wrench''': Well, here it is. Had to hoof-build some of the parts myself, but it's as good as new.
:'''Applejack''': Hoo-wee! This looks amazin', Torque. Nopony else could have pulled this off.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you so much for your help.
:'''Torque Wrench''': It was a real challenge, but turns out that was part of the fun! [chuckles]
:[music]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Applejack''': Whoa! D-Did y'all see that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now we need to test it.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Should we call the mayor?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Might be best to make sure it works first. I'd hate to disappoint him.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Twilight, I think I saw—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': In a moment, Applejack. This is important.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah, but—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Turn on the Generator.
:'''Applejack''': Oh. Okay.
:[clicking and whirring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Petunia Petals''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Torque Wrench''': [gasp]
:[machinery continues]
:[sheen!]
:'''Applejack''': Huh! Well, look at that!
:'''Petunia Petals''': Oh, isn't it beautiful? That's what the Generator has always done for years and years.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now we just add magic, and...
:[boom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Applejack''', '''Petunia Petals''', and '''Torque Wrench''': [sigh]
:[music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] I'm sorry. I thought for sure it would work.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Let's not tell the mayor. It would break his heart.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. We have to tell him we failed. We can't bring the color back.
:'''Applejack''': Hmm... Twilight! I really think you should see this. You betcha—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We did it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Petunia Petals''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [humming] Everything you need for the Rainbow Festival bake sale!
:'''Moody Root''': [grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': Courtesy of the Hoofingtons.
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': And Mr. Moody Root!
:'''Moody Root''': [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! Everything looks delicious!
:'''Petunia Petals''': Mr. Moody Root! Why, I haven't see ya in the library in ages.
:'''Moody Root''': High time I came back. Hey, you got any of them there cookbooks?
:[whoosh!]
:'''Moody Root''': Wha?
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [laughing]
:[music]
:'''Torque Wrench''': Hey, they're pretty good.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': They've been practicing their tails off for the big show.
:[whoosh!]
:'''Torque Wrench''': What big show?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The Rainbow Festival. They're the official entertainment.
:[music]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Mm!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [grunting]
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, landing still needs a little work.
:'''Rarity''': You're all here! Wonderful! You can help us set up our cart. Kerfuffle's official Rainbow Festival accessories.
:'''Kerfuffle''': Ta-da!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh, whoa-ho-ho! Nice stuff.
:'''Kerfuffle''': And I designed color-matched assessories<!--that's how she says it, don't change--> for each of ya!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, I can't help but notice that the color-matched accessories don't have much color.
:'''Rarity''': Well, of course not, silly. The town doesn't have any color, remember?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, right.
:'''Kerfuffle''': Oh, but don't worry. I know where the colors are ''supposed'' to be. An orange scarf for Applejack, red leggings fer Fluttershy...
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh.
:'''Kerfuffle''': The pink flower lei is for, well, you-know-who.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, who? [laughs] Mm-hmm.
:'''Rarity''': And look at my purple kerchief. Isn't it divine?
:'''Kerfuffle''': The blue goggles are fer Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh-ho-ho.
:'''Kerfuffle''': [to Barley and Pickle] And I think I have some that might match for you two.
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Whoa!
:'''Barley Barrel''': Whoa!
:'''Kerfuffle''': And somethin' very special for Princess Twilight. Wing bling! In every shade of the rainbow, don'tcha know?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Kerfuffle, this is amazing! Everypony, you've done great work. [sighs] I just wish I could've done my part. I hate to admit it, but I'm stuck. I don't know how to make the town's color come back.
:'''Applejack''': [spits] That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya! It ''is'' comin' back!
:[magic sounds]
:[ponies exclaim]
:[magic sounds continue]
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Whoa!
:'''Fluttershy''': What's happening?
:'''Rarity''': Something wonderful!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But how? It wasn't the Generator. Which means something ''else'' must have drained the town's color in the first place! I have to get back to the library!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I thought so! Look. In the second photo, when the Generator goes off, this pony is walking away. But on the ''third'' photo, when all the color's gone, he's back where he was. Which means...
:'''Petunia Petals''': [gasps] We have to tell the mayor!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Tell me what?
:'''Petunia Petals''': Sunny! Have you seen what's happenin' outside?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': No, I've been in here fer a while workin' on my speech.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we should just show him.

:'''Mr. Hoofington''': Who wants apricot pies? Best pies in Hope Hollow!
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Pies for sale! Yummylicious!
:'''Pony #2''': Hello there, Mr. Hoofington, Mrs. Hoofington. Been a while.
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': How lovely to see you.
:[magic sounds]
:'''Mr. Hoofington''': [gasps]
:'''Mrs. Hoofington''': Oh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What's better than ''one'' pie? Lots of pies! Official Rainbow Festival goodness right here now!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Moody Root''': [gasps]
:'''Rarity''': Over here, darlings! Just look what Kerfuffle has come up with!
:'''Customer #1''': I never knew you did such great work. I have to visit your shop.
:'''Trout Pony''': Hey, ya got anythin' waterproof?
:'''Kerfuffle''': Mm-hmm. Whoa!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [gasps] Oh! But... colors! So you were able to reverse the Generator?
:'''Petunia Petals''': The Generator had nothin' to do with it and never did.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': So none of it was my fault?
:'''Petunia Petals''': No, ya big doofus! How many times have I tried to tell ya that? All those years, ya blamed yerself for nuthin'.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': These photos from the library explain everything. Once I realized they were out of order, it proved that the town's colors got dim ''before'' you turned on the Generator.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Boy howdy, am I glad to hear that! But then, what ''did'' cause it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's called "Hopeless Magic". Everypony was already giving up each other, losing hope. Then, when the Generator blew up, it must have been the last straw. It took all the hope out of the town for good, along with the color. But now there's a different kind of magic. Of everypony coming together again. Just the way you wanted it, Mayor.
:'''Torque Wrench''': Whadaya know? There ''is'' still a Rainbow Festival.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And we'd better get it started. This town's been waiting long enough.
:'''Torque Wrench''': The Generator's workin' again, Mr. Mayor, just the way your grandpa built her.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Heh. I just hope my speech lives up to the occasion.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Attention, please! Welcome to the brand new Hope Hollow Annual Rainbow Festival! And here's the pony who made it all possible – Mayor Sunny Skies!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': I am as proud as a two-tailed peacock to see you all here today to once again celebrate our little town at the end of the rainbow.
:[cheering]
:'''Kerfuffle''': Ohhh...
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': And I can't give enough thanks to Rainbow Dash, Princess Twilight...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': ...Pinkie Pie...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': ...Fluttershy...
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': ...Rarity, and Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': Heh.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': My grandpa started this festival to celebrate us, the ponies of Hope Hollow. It's you who brought friendship back to our town, and all the bright colors that come with it.
:'''Girl Pony''': Aw.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': We just have to always remember to reach a hoof out to our neighbors, to respect and listen and talk to each other. You never know what just sayin' "hello" to somepony can do. So, without further ado...
:'''[Pinkie Pie]''':
::Here we go
::This is the moment, yeah
::Let the Rainbow Festival begin!
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': [awkward laugh]
:[generator whirring]
:[ponies gasping]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Colt''': Whoa, what's happening?
:'''Torque Wrench''': Wow.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Whoa.
:'''Kerfuffle''': It's exactly as I imagined it!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Petunia Petals''': That was a beautiful speech, Sunny.
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': What? Oh, no, uh, that wasn't my speech.
:'''Petunia Petals''': Uh, but, uh, then what have you been writin' all day?
:'''Mayor Sunny Skies''': Well, uh, another speech. I mean, it's for later, but... Oh, flapjacks. I guess now is as good a time as any. [sighs] Petunia, you've never given up on me or the town. You always had hope when we had none, and I can't imagine a day without you. ''You're'' the pony who brings color into my life. Petunia Petals, will you marry me?
:'''Petunia Petals''': Of course, ya silly goose!
:[all cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Attention, everypony! Introducing Hope Hollow's very own Junior Wonderbolts!
:[cheering]
:'''Barley Barrel''': Did you hear what she called us?!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': Did ''you'' hear what she called us?!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': Junior Wonderbolts! [laugh]
:'''Pickle Barrel''': All right!
:'''Barley''' and '''Pickle Barrel''': [laugh]
:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, guys. Showtime!
:'''Pickle Barrel''': [chuckles]
:[music continues]
:[boom!]
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. Now ''this'' is something I'm proud to be a guest of honor for! [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': And it looks like there's a butterfly garden after all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Only one more thing could make this Rainbow Festival better.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, not more karaoke, darling.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What? No. A trout DJ!
:'''Trout Pony''': [toots harmonica]
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Now ''that's'' a party!
