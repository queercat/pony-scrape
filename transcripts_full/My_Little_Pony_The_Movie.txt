:'''Spike''': 'Scuse me! Dragon on the move! Important princess documents comin' through!
:'''S04E26 Unnamed Earth Mare #1''': Whoa! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here!
:'''Apple Cobbler''': I know, filly! We almost couldn't book a stable!
:'''Clear Skies''': Princess Twilight must have her hooves full with this giant Festival!
:'''Female Pony 2''': Are you kidding?! She's smart and organized and cool under pressure! There's nothing she can't handle!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. [facehoofs] Ohhhh!
:'''Spike''': Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting!
:'''Spike''': Whachoo talkin' 'bout?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor! What if they reject me?
:'''Spike''': It'll be fine. Just remember the most important thing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Smile?!
:'''Spike''': Eh... no. You're a Princess, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right! [exhales] Good morning, Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Yes, Twilight! We are very excited!
:'''Princess Cadance''': Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'd like to think it's to see us, but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, she ''is'' the... "mane" event! [giggles] And to make it ''extra'' special, I could use your help. Spike?
:[whiteboard wheeling in]
:'''Spike''': [humming fanfare]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1º to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62º to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!
:'''Princess Luna''': I...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun ''and'' the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!
:'''Spike''': Presenting Songbird Serenade!
::Yeah, yeah, yeah!
::Whoa-ho!
:Whoa!
:[bonk!]
:'''Spike''': [weakly] Ta-da...
:'''Princess Luna''': So you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'd do it myself, except I don't have your magic. [snorts]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our ''own'' way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So... that'd be a no?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes!
:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sky's cleared and ready for the festival!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blowing up a balloon]
:[balloon squeaking]
:[balloon deflating]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[birds whistling in harmony]
:[balloon zooming by]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloooooon!!
:'''Fluttershy''': Hoo. I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie!
:'''Applejack''': Hey, y'all!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''': Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ah! Thank you! Loved it!
:'''Rarity''': [humming]
:'''Applejack''': Wow, Rarity. It's a fine job you're doin' there. 'Course it might not get done 'til ''after'' the concert.
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, anypony can do "fine". Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fabulous takes forever! But "awesome"...
:[flies past]
:'''Fluttershy''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...can get done in four seconds flat! ''Faster'' if I do my sonic rainboom!
:'''Rarity''': Aah! Nono, oh no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh come on, it's fine!
:'''Rarity''': If you were raised in a barn! Ahem, no offense, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': None taken. Especially since I wasn't raised in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn. Where I was born. And... spent most of my formative years...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [very quickly] Raised in a barn!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready.
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Fluttershy''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, Twilight!
:'''Rarity''': Hello, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Uh, hi, Rarity. Heh heh.
:'''Applejack''': How'd it go with the other Princesses? They like your idea?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I bet they loved it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic.
:'''Rarity''': And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is ''your'' brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But what if I'm not?! What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?! Or nopony makes a new friend?! And if I fail at the festival, then who am I?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight, look at me! This will be the biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen! As the Princess of Friendship, you cannot fail! This day will define who you are! The pressure is intense! ''It's almost too much for any single pony to handle!'' [screams] 
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But you have us! So stop worrying.
:[clink!]
:[magic whirs off]
:[balloon pops]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [burps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah!
{{#lst:We Got This Together|song}}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps, yells, groans]
:[ponies gasping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie!
:[splat!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nickers] Hmmm...
:'''Code Red''': Songbird Serenade? Is it really her? It is, it is!
:'''Songbird Serenade''': Hiya. I'm lookin' for the pony in charge?
:[camera flashing]
:'''Songbird Serenade''': I need to set up for my sound check.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just going to check on you. [laughs nervously] I'm Princess Twilight, and sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so...
:[ponies gasping]
:'''Female pony''': Oh! How embarrassing!
:'''Songbird Serenade''': Caked in cake?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Heh heh.
:'''Vinny''': You have visual on buttercream?
:'''Whinnyfield''': Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup.
:[thunder]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... I... don't think those are storm clouds.
:[ominous music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered!
:[crumbling]
:[balloons deflate]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...Or definitely ''not'' the clowns I ordered.
:[balloon deflates]
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Party Favor''': Brian, no!
:'''Grubber''': [breathing and grunting]
:[microphone feedback]
:'''Grubber''': [clears throat, voice echoing] Ponieth of Equethtria, we come on behalf of the fearsome, the powerful, the almighty...''Thtorm King!''
:[ponies cowering and whispering]
:'''Female pony''': This is terrible!
:'''Grubber''': And now, to deliver the evil, evil methage, put your hooveth together for Commander Tempeeeetht!
:[sparking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is that a... unicorn?
:'''Spike''': I think so, but what happened to her horn?
:'''Princess Celestia''': "Tempest" is it? How may we help you?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Oh, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi there. Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Oh, goody. All four Princesses. Here's the deal, ladies. I need your magic. Give it up nicely, please, or we make it difficult for everyone!
:'''Princess Luna''': And why should we cower before you? There's one of you and hundreds of us.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [chuckles] I was hoping you'd choose "difficult".
:[storm creatures growl]
:[airships hovering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Princess Cadance''': [gasps]
:[storm creatures roar]
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [grunts]
:'''Princess Cadance''': [grunts, screams]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Cadance!
:'''Princess Cadance''': [gasps] I can't... stop it!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [grunts]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Luna, quick! Go south beyond the Badlands!
:'''Princess Luna''': Hmph!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [grunts]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Seek help from the Queen of the Hippo— [screams]
:'''Princess Luna''': [gasps, grunts, yelps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Luna!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [chuckles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twilight!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [chuckles] Easy as pie.
:'''Grubber''': Oh, I love pie.<!--changed to "cake" for one TV spot--> Oh, you totally got the latht Printheth!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': That's not the Princess! Grubber, get her now!
:'''Grubber''': Guyth, we gotta get the Princess!
:[clatter]
:'''Applejack''': Over here, y'all!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Come on!
:'''Mane Six''': [panting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:[bridge crumbles]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:[splash!]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp for air, scream]
:[music grows intense]
:[music becomes quieter]
:'''Grubber''': Which one of you guyth ith goin' down there?
:[storm creatures growl]
:'''Grubber''': [sighs] I would, but I jutht had a hearty meal, and I will think and I ''will'' thide-cramp. I'm very big-boned. I think quick.

:[water flowing]
:'''Rarity''': [catching her breath]
:'''Applejack''': Everypony okay?
:'''Rarity''': I think my bottom's on backward.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We gotta go back there and fight!
:'''Spike''': Well, you saw the size of those goons. You seriously wanna go back?
:'''Applejack''': So now what? We can't hide here forever. And let's be honest, we ''can't'' go back. Look at what they did to the Princesses. We gotta keep them from Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Queen.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the... "Hippos". Luna can't, so I have to.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, hippos? Seriously?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. Huh, but they're always hungry.
:'''Spike''': Hungry?
:'''Applejack''': Hippos?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're somewhere south, past the Badlands.
:'''Fluttershy''': That means we'll have to... leave Equestria. Oh!
:'''Rarity''': I'm not even packed!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope.
:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, you're not getting ''all'' the glory. We're in this together.
:'''Applejack''': We got your back.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Indeedy!
:'''Rarity''': I am ready to save Equestria!
:'''Fluttershy''': Yay.
:'''Spike''': We're all behind you, Twilight.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's go find this hippo!
:'''Spike''': Uh, south?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hehe! Whee! [giggles] Whee! Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy! Anypony up for a game of "I Spy"?
:'''All but Pinkie Pie''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, really! Come on! I spy with my little eye something that is orange. No takers? It's you, Applejack! [giggles]

:[storm creatures grunting]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': All this power wasted on parties when there are far greater uses.
:[ringtone]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Well? Answer it!
:[dial-up modem noises]
:'''The Storm King''': Where am I supposed to be looking? I never understand how this spell works. Tempest!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Over here, Your Excellency.
:'''The Storm King''': Where?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Over here.
:'''The Storm King''': Huh?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': No. No, right. Look right.
:'''The Storm King''': My right?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Yep.
:'''The Storm King''': Oh. There you are. Here's the deal. I'm in the middle of a big re-brand here. "The Storm King" is tracking well as "intensely intimidating", but you know what? I need to back it up. You know what I need to back it up with? ''A storm!'' That would be great! You promised me magic that could control the elements, and right now, I'm holding a what? A branch. A twig. Bleh!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Uh, that would be the Staff of Sacanas, Your Excellency, and it will...
:'''The Storm King''': Mm-hmm?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': ...channel the magic of the four rulers of this land.
:'''The Storm King''': Mm-hmmmm?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': You'll soon have the power of a hundred armies.
:'''The Storm King''': So that would be a yes on your locking down the four Pegacornicuseses, or whatever you call them?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Give me three days. I'll have everything ready for your arrival.
:'''The Storm King''': [ominous] Remember, Tempest. Only I have the power to make you whole. Make this twig work, and you'll get your reward. Fail me, and your horn won't be the only thing that's broken.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': It won't be a problem.
:'''The Storm King''': [upbeat] Great! [warbling] I'm ready to power up, crash and bash, and be the biggest, baddest bugaloooooo...
:[beat]
:'''Grubber''': Thorry, bad thpell thervice. You want me to call him back?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Do you have the Princess?
:'''Grubber''': Well, uh, funny thtory. It kinda theemth like she... she might've like, you know, got away... a little bit. I know you're dithappointed, but I got one word for you: "thpongecake".
:[zap]
:'''Grubber''': [screams]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I need all four for the staff to work.
:'''Grubber''': Hey, I know! I want the Thtorm King to fix that crazy horn as badly as ''you'' do. It lookth like a crackly chipped tooth on the top of your head. And you know you don't look good in hatth.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': That Princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back! Prepare my ship!
:'''Grubber''': Ihhh!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Please. How far could one little pony get on her own?

:[slide guitar sting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] There's sand in my... everything... Heh... Saving... Equestria... [demented laugh] Oh! Look! Maybe this guy knows which way to go! What's that, friend?  We're lost? [demented laugh, coughs, faints]
:'''Rarity''', '''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Spike''': [panting]
:'''Spike''': We could be going in... circles! Endless... sand... [inhales] Nothin' for miles... but sand... [breathes] and this rock... [coughs] and this cactus... [breathes] and this roooooooooaaaaaad.... [breathes, faints, breathes] ...this rooooooad....
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm? A road? Where there's a road, there's a... [gasps]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cool!
:'''Applejack''': What is that?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh! A city! [scoffs] We are doing it, you guys! 
:'''Rarity''': You know what they say: where there's a city, there's a spa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Who'' says that?
:'''Applejack''': 'Case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria.
:'''Rarity''': I can multitask.

:[bird squawking]
:'''Pig Creature 1''': Don't worry, little one, we'll let ya go!
:'''Pig Creature 2''': To the highest bidder!
:'''Pig Creatures''': [laugh]

:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi there! Ooh, I'm sorry. Here. Lemme help you with that.
:'''Pushkin''': Hey! No magic around my merchandise!
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Capper''': Hmmm... Very interesting...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. We just gotta stick together. Be careful who you talk to. And try to blend in.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can I have your attention please?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?!
:'''Mori''': You want something? You gotta give something!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend?
:[honk]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you.
:'''Pig Creature 1''': [belches]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, you can't just take off! [through clenched teeth] And you don't need to announce to every...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Relax, Twilight! I totally got this!
:'''Louise''': How much for the giant gecko?
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Spike''': Who you callin' a gecko?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Spike isn't for sale.
:'''Vera''': I want that fancy purple hair! I'll give ya two storm bucks for it!
:'''Rarity''': Two storm bucks?! It's worth more than that!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Heh?
:[various creatures bidding]
:'''Deer Creature''': Gimme that pink one!
:'''Pig Creature 1''':  I'll take the blue one!
:'''Pig Creature 2''': No! ''I'' want the blue one!
:'''Louise''': I need that lizard!
:'''Creature 1''': I'll take that picture of your sister!
:'''Deer Creature''': I want all seven for my collection!
:'''Capper''': Back up, everyone! Back it up! Y'all in some serious danger! Now you didn't touch any of them, did you? Just look at all those colors! You think that's natural? They're infected with "pastelis coloritis".
:[creatures gasping]
:'''Applejack''': Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't—
:'''Capper''': Don't worry, don't worry, as long as you're not covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine. Uh-oh.
:'''Mori''': [gasps] What do I do?!
:'''Capper''': Enjoy your last moments and don't touch anyone. Because parts ''will'' fall off.
:'''Mori''': [screams] Me parts!
:'''Vera''': [gasps]
:'''Capper''': Well, all right. [purrs]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You are awesome!
:'''Capper''': Mm-hm.
:'''Rarity''': And quite charming. [giggles]
:'''Spike''': Huh!
:'''Capper''': Capper's the name. Charming's my game. So... to the Hippos, then?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know if we should trust him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We could definitely use a friend out here!
:'''Capper''': You know what? Little Cotton Candy Hair is right. And, if I do say so myself...
{{#lst:I'm the Friend You Need|song}}
:'''Capper''': Welcome, my little ponies, to my little manor.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! A sort of a roco-hobo-Bohemian hodgepodge.
:'''Capper''': Apologies for the state of my litter box. I wasn't expecting guests.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! So many fun breakables!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles]
:'''Capper''': Y'all sure y'all want the Hippos?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yessirree! The ''Queen'' of the Hippos!
:'''Capper''': Not like the Queen of the Lions, or Tigers, or Bears?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?

:[storm creature grunting]
:'''Vera''': [screaming]
:'''Toothy Klugetowner''': Please! Please! I don't know anything! [screams]
:'''Grubber''': You really think the ponieth got thith far?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [sniffs] Oh, they're here. Attention! A little purple pony passed this way. Tell me where she is...
:'''Grubber''': ...or thumpin real bad'th gonna happen. [squeaks]
:'''Mori''': You think we're gonna fall for this again? I don't know what kinda scam you're workin' with Capper and the rest of your friends, but--
:'''Tempest Shadow''': "Friends?"
:'''Mori''': Poison or no poison, you're gonna pay!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [grunts]
:'''Mori''': [groans]
:'''Grubber''': Ohhhh, Fishman juth got dropped!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now...
:'''Mori''': Ihhhh...
:'''Tempest Shadow''': ...about this... "Capper"...
:[horn charges up]

:["The Girl from Ipanema" playing]
:[Mane Six and Capper laughing]
:'''Capper''': Stop playin' me! A sonic rainboom? That's not a real thang! Is that a real thing?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll show ya!
:'''Capper''': Naw-naw-naw, I don't need you sonic "rainbooming" up in my place, thank you very much. Whoa, hey, hold up now. Whoa.
:'''Rarity''': Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous.
:'''Capper''': Okay... What's the catch?
:'''Rarity''': Nothing. After all that you've done for us, consider it a "thank you".
:'''Capper''': Oh. Uh, don't thank me. Really.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos! We need the Queen of the Hippo''griffs''! Part pony, part eagle!
:'''Capper''': Oh! Oh, the Hippo''griffs''! Now, the trouble with that is... no one knows... where they are...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You mean the mountain right outside the window?
:'''Capper''': Objects in windows may be less mountainous than they appear. Heh heh heh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's go, everypony.
:'''Capper''': [gasps] Wait! [cat yowl] You can't—you can't make it by y'allselves. You need an airship! And lucky for you, I can get you a ride.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think we can get there on our own.
:[door opens]
:'''Verko''': Here's Verko! [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Verko''': These ponies better shoot rainbow lasers out their eyes if they're gonna settle your debt! Brought the big cage. Let's load 'em up!
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rarity''': You were... You were going to ''sell'' us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew it! We gotta get outta here!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [chuckles evilly]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Silly little ponies.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tempest!
:'''Spike''': [screams]
:'''Fluttershy''': [squeaks]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [resumes chuckling] Trusting strangers? Big mistake. Big...
:'''Grubber''': Huge!
:'''Verko''': Hoo-hoo! My goodness! Well, look at you! With your scary broken horn and scowly eyes. What tricks do ''you'' know, my little pony-wony?
:[zap!]
:'''Verko''': [weakly] Not bad... [faints]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Go! Go!

:'''Rarity''': Rats?

:[storm creatures growling]
:'''Capper''': [grunts]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now... where are they going?
:[horn charges up]
:'''Capper''': Okay. No need for violence. Uh, they're headed...
:[button sparkles]

:'''Capper''': They headed east! Yeah, to... to Black Skull Island. So, uh, glad I could be of service to His Majesty, the Storm King. I'll just be on my way. [yowls]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': When I get my Princess. Until then, your fate is still... up in the air.
:'''Grubber''': [laughs] Oh, you're gonna go in the thkiff! Which ith a boat! Thpethifically, a air-boat! [laughs]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Blugh!
:'''Applejack''': Whadaya think, Twilight? Should we just... ask 'em to take us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Last time we trusted somepony, he tried to sell us!
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Boyle''': Hey, guys! Come check ''this'' out!
:'''Mullet''': Looks like a pack of stowaways.
:'''Lix Spittle''': What are we s'posed to do with 'em?
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Boyle''': I think we tie 'em up!
:'''Applejack''': [gasps]
:'''Lix Spittle''': [squawks] We clip their wings!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Mullet''': Nah. We scar 'em...
:'''Rarity''': [yelps]
:'''Mullet''': ...emotionally!
:'''Fluttershy''': [sobs]
:'''Mullet''': Wai-wai-wai-wait. What say the book, Captain Celaeno?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Storm King's rule book says, "Throw them overboard."
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:[parrots grunting]
:[union whistle blows]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': All right! That's lunch!
:[splut]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?
:[munching]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break?
:'''Boyle''': Storm King only allows one break a day for meals, then it's back to hauling goods.
:'''Spike''': So you're delivery guys?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': And gals. These uniforms aren't exactly doing us any favors.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then can you deliver us to Mount Aris?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders or we suffer his wrath.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. Still going overboard.
:'''Lix Spittle''': Eh, it's nothing personal. Pudding?
:'''Rarity''': There's pudding?
:[splut]
:'''Rarity''': Oh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Yeah. We used to be much more adventurous. 
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa! You used to be ''pirates''?!
:'''Mullet''': Um, we prefer the term "swashbuckling treasure hunters".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So... pirates.
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You birds have a choice to make. You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or...
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...you could be awesome again!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a—

:'''Captain Celaeno''': Come on! Let's show these little ponies how it's done!
:'''Mane Six except Twilight''': [oohing and ahing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Awesome! I ''knew'' you had it in ya! And now for the finishing touch!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No no no no no! No!
:[sonic rainboom]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, yeah! [laughs]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Wow!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohhh!

:'''Grubber''': [slurping] Huh? Huh? Looka that rainbow! Looka that rainbow! Whoa, that'th so cool!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Yeah. Of them to alert us. Funny, though. [to Capper] They don't seem to be heading to Black Skull Island.
:'''Capper''': Like "ha ha" funny or... ha ha...
:'''Grubber''': [yells]
:[airship backfiring]

:[swords clanging]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Yeah! Ha ha!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nice!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': [laughs]
:'''Squabble''': [squawking]
:[bell ringing]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Storm guards! Looks like they found you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tempest!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo! Everyone, prepare to be boarded!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh my goodness!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you ''kidding me''?!

:[thud!]
:[pirates yelping]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Grubber''': [grunts]
:[storm creatures grunt]
:'''Grubber''': [chomps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Where is the Pony Princess?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': "Princess"? Prin-Cess, Prin-Cess... Nope. All we're hauling is Storm King merchandise.
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': You do realize that if you ''were'' to shelter fugitives, the Storm King would be quite... explosive.
:'''Captain Celaeno''': [gulps]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering loudly] We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispering loudly] We helped them get their mojo back! They're not gonna give us up!
:'''Rarity''': [breathes loudly]
:'''Fluttershy''': [shivers]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[crash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:[woodwinds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've got this!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now, I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't tell me where they are, your ship is going down. One... 

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hold this!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What are you doing?!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': ...two...
:'''Grubber''': Oh, thith is inteeenth!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Three!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': What?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': [gasps]

:'''Rarity''': ''Oh, for Celestia's sake''!!!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams, laughs] Whee!
:'''Fluttershy''': [yells] I can't look!
:'''Rarity''': [screams] Ooh! [resumes screaming] Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''': What in the hay is she up to?
:[strings and brass building up]
:'''Spike''': [yelps] Huh? [breathes fire]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee-hee-hee!
:'''Mane Six''': [sighing]
:'''Rarity''': Thank goodness.
:'''Applejack''': Phee-yew! Quick thinkin', Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yahoo! Ha ha!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was fun! Can we do it again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Next stop, Mount Aris!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're home free!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]

:'''Grubber''': There'th no ponieth. But I found thith. It'th a... kind of a cupcake... with thprinkleth... Oh, yeah, and I found thith, too.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Huh.
:'''Grubber''': Wow, this is a ''real'' artitht!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Looks like they're heading to Mount Aris.
:'''Capper''': Really? [stammering and laughing nervously] Mou- Mount Aris? I... Well, that's my mis— I didn't know that... Mount Ari... My bad, I didn't... That's my... I'm sorry, I'm very very sorry.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now, about your betrayal...

:[splashes]

:[waves crashing]
:'''Rarity''': We ''had'' to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain! That's it! I simply... cannot... even! I have nothing! The bad guys have won! I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We're almost there!
:'''Rarity''': [growls] Will you stop saying that?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No, really! We're actually here!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] This is it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh!
:'''Applejack''': Well, I'll be. [laughs] Hippogriffs, here we come!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Time to rest my hooves!
:[quiet strings and woodwinds]
:'''Rarity''': Are we sure this is the right place?
:'''Applejack''': Hello?! Is anypony home?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No Hippogriffies here! Or here! Or here! Or here or here or here! Waaaaaiiit! Nope! This place is emp-ty!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But... Celestia... The map. They have to be here.
:'''Spike''': Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town.
:'''Fluttershy''': A g-g-g-g-ghost town?!
:[distant humming]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] It's coming from over there!
:[humming continues to grow louder]
:[crumbles]
:'''Princess Skystar''': [gasps] What was that?!
:[splash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! Wait up! Cannonball!
:[splash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sputters] She's gone!
:[water flushing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now what?
:[bubbles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures.
:'''Mane Six''': [screaming, trying to talk]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps for air]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasping for air]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't ''make'' these bubbles!
:'''Fluttershy''': Then [pants] who did?
:[something swimming past]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs.
:'''Princess Skystar''': How do I know I can trust you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Please. The Storm King invaded our land. And we need their help.
:'''Princess Skystar''': The Storm King?! I'm so glad I saved you guys! I'm totally taking you to my mom!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Does your mother know where they are?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oho! [singsongy] She might have an idea! [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hoo-hoo!
:[bubbles]

:'''Princess Skystar''': We're almost there!
:[choir and orchestra playing]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Wow!
:[choir and orchestra continue]
:'''Princess Skystar''': Mother, look what I found!
:'''Queen Novo''': Is it another shell?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Mm-mm.
:'''Queen Novo''': Because I am telling you if it is another shell, I am— [gasps loudly] Princess Skystar, whatta you done?! You know surface dwellers are forbidden here! Guards!
:[guards grunting]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Princess Skystar''': No no n-no! M-M-Mom, please! It is so not like that! The Storm King is trying to destroy ''their'' home, too!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them?
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, of course I know. I'm the queen. I know ''everything''.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, oh, it's such a good story!
:'''Queen Novo''': Don't you dare tell them!
:'''Princess Skystar''': Once upon a time, like, a while ago, the Hippogriffs ''did'' live on Mount Aris.
:'''Mane Six''': Oooh!
:'''Queen Novo''': Did I not say don't tell them? But hey, I'm just the queen. Don't mind me.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Fine! I can't tell you! But if I ''could'' tell you, I'd say that that horned beast did show up to steal their magic!
:'''Queen Novo''': Seriously?
:'''Princess Skystar''': But, to keep it out of his clutches, their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo, hid them deep underwater where he could never go! We ''are''... Well, we ''were'' the Hippogriffs! Ta-da! [laughs] [whispering] But I totally did not tell you that!
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, I guess the pearl is out the oyster now. ''I'' am Queen Novo.
:'''Applejack''': Hold on now. Lemme get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled?
:'''Princess Skystar''': We didn't flee! We swam! Y'know, in order to flee.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But... how?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh! Can we show them? Huh? These are the first guests we've had in, like, foreveeerrr! Can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we?
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, I suppose I ''should'' make sure it still works. [chuckles]
:'''Princess Skystar''': [giggles]
:'''Queen Novo''': Careful, now.
:'''Princess Skystar''': [squeals]
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! Oh! [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': Oh. Wa-wa-whoa! [laughs]
:'''Mane Six''': [awed reactions]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': These fins are divine!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral!
:'''Applejack''': You're on!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo! [giggles] Ooh! Try it, Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] Yay.
:'''Spike''': Guys? Guys? What is... [puffs] ...happening?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Aw, so cute!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army!
:'''Queen Novo''': Or it could end up in his greedy claws!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But...
:'''Queen Novo''': Honey, I'm sorry about your home. I truly am. But my responsibility is to protect ''my'' subjects. The pearl... is not going anywhere.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here! Trapped forever! There's so much you're missing!
:'''Queen Novo''': We are one hundred percent okay with that!
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Yes, Jamal?
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Ooh! Time for my seaweed wrap.
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Yes, a massage, too. Mama needs her deep tissue.
:'''Applejack''': So that's it? We left home for nothin'?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, my gosh! Best... idea! You can stay with us! Forever! [laughs] There are so many things we can do! We can make friendship bracelets out of shells and... picture frames outta shells and... decorative wastebaskets out of shells... Oh, I have so many projects that involve shells, haha! Now I have someone new to share them with! I mean, aside from my friends, Shelly and Sheldon. Right? "Shelly"?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Princess Skystar''': And "Sheldon"? [chuckles] Get it? [chuckles, snorts]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, ooh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay.
:'''Applejack''': We've gotta get back to our families.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, no. Of course. Of course. Heh. Of course you have your own friends back home. It's fine. It's fine. Heh. [whispering] Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways. Heh. It's probably for the best. [sighs] Yeah, I'll just, um... [sadly] I'll get Mom to, uh, turn you back so you can go home.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer?
:'''Applejack''': Pinkie, we just don't have time for—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. No no. Pinkie's right.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Say what now?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we still need to come up with a plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, it's Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squee]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I won't let you down!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm counting on it.

:'''Female seapony''': The pearl alarm! Oh, no, the pearl alarm!

:[alarm continues]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [struggling] Ow!
:'''Queen Novo''': [snarls]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! Please!
:'''Queen Novo''': All of this so you could sneak in and take the pearl?!
:'''Princess Skystar''': [yelps]
:'''Queen Novo''': [to Skystar] This is why we don't bring strangers into our home! [to Twilight, ominously] You don't deserve to be one of us.

:'''Mane Six''': [gasping for air]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing]
:'''Rarity''': [gasping, faints]
:'''Applejack''': What were you thinkin'? I mean, stealin' their pearl?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] It was the only way to save Equestria.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': 'Cept it wasn't! The Queen was going to say yes! We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving! [gasps] Unless... You didn't really ''want'' us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to ''distract her''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Rarity''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I never would have ''done'' it, but this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make rainbooms in the sky and expect everything to work out! It's not enough! We are not enough!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, Twilight! ''We'' stuck together! ''We'' were gonna get the help we needed! The only thing that stopped us... was ''you''!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm ''doing the best I can!''  It's all on me. ''I'm'' the one Tempest wants. ''I'm'' the last Princess!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're ''also'' the only one who ''doesn't trust her friends''!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, maybe, I would've been better off without ''friends like YOU''!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[soft strings]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, I-
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sniffles] I just can't talk to you right now.

:[waves crashing]
:[piano]
:'''Spike''': Twilight? It's okay. You'll figure it out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [tearfully] No! [sobs] I ''can't''. I ruined everything! [sobs quietly] There's no chance to save Equestria now. [whimpers] It's all my fault! [weeps] Spike? [gasps]
:'''Spike''': [muffled] Twilight, look out!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screams, gasps] No, no, no, no, no! Noooooo!
:'''Spike''': [muffled] Twilight, help me!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Aww, the "Princess of Friendship". With no friends! [chuckles] And no way out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why are you doing this? You're a pony! Just like me.
:[zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I'm nothing like you! I'm more than you'll ever be!
{{#lst:Open Up Your Eyes|song}}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm so sorry you felt so alone.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I saw the truth. My "friends" abandoned me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, Princess. Friendship has failed you, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship.

:[silence]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] This whole journey was such a mistake. [gasps] All we wanted was somepony to help us.
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight?
:'''Spike''': She's! Been! ''Taken!!!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:'''Spike''': [panting] Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her! And took her on her ship!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We gotta get her back!
:'''Fluttershy''': How? We'll ''never'' catch up!
:'''Applejack''': And we got no way to defeat those monsters.
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs]
:'''Capper''': Well, good thing I happen to know of a group of mighty heroes that could handle this easily!
:'''Rarity''': [angrily] Well! Look what the cat dragged in! Himself!
:'''Capper''': These heroes have faced the Storm King's army and escaped! I've seen them tackle the streets of the roughest towns, break out of the tightest situations, and inspire others to join their cause!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Ooooh.
:'''Applejack''': Now don't get too excited. He's just talkin' about us.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Awww.
:'''Capper''': They even escaped certain doom at the hooves of Commander Tempest!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. That ''was'' pretty great.
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Are you kidding me?! That was ''awesome''!
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Boyle''': Figured you could use a claw!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': We're on board to help you fight the Storm King! Just not on board our... actual ship.
:'''Mullet''': That crazy unicorn sunk it. But you got back our argh! And we're ready to kick some booty.
:'''Boyle''' and '''other pirates''': [laugh heartily]

:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Capper''': Is that what I think it is?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Hellooooooo!! Me again! [giggles] I'm gonna get so grounded, but I talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon and they pointed out that you were just trying to help your friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ahhhh!
:'''Princess Skystar''': So I wanna help too. 'Cause ya know... one small thing... [whispering] can make a really big difference!
:'''Spike''': That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else?
:'''Capper''': All right, y'all! I think our course is clear. Y'all ready to do this thang?

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Your magic? Did you think you'd keep it all to yourself? Time to share. I'd love for everybody out there to know what I can really do.
:'''The Storm King''': Ooh, fascinating!  What ''can'' you really do?
:'''Grubber''': Your bidding, of courth, Your Mighty One.

:'''The Storm King''': Bidding's good. I like bidding! Um, what are you supposed to be?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm the Princess of Friendship!
:'''The Storm King''': [laughs] Oh. That's nice. [to Tempest] Why is this one still moving?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': She and her friends put up a bit of a fight, but she's alone now. She won't be a problem.
:'''The Storm King''': Yeah. So, speaking of problems, this place, it seems a little too—oh, I don't know—''cute!!!'' I don't like cute! I never did like cute! Doesn't really go with my whole "big bad powerful magic guy" thing, does it?! Deliver the punchline, Tempest, because this has gotta be a joke! [grunts]
