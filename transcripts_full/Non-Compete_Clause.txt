:[papers fluttering]
:'''Yona''': Huh?
:[whooshing]
:'''Silverstream''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
:'''Applejack''': You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, right. I got this one nailed.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
:'''Applejack''': [groans] Again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.
:[camera flashes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. Me, neither.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Congratulations, Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
:[pages flapping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—
:'''Applejack''': I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
:'''Applejack''': [stutters]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [stutters]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.
:'''Applejack''': Of course!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Totally!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [groans, chuckles]

:'''Ocellus''': I've never been on a field trip before.
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?
:'''Gallus''': Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
:'''Yona''': Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts]
:'''Silverstream''': That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]
:'''Sandbar''': [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles nervously] With ''us'' in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. Good one.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
{|
|
:'''Applejack''':
:Shed buildin'!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Canoe racing!
|}
:'''Silverstream''': No... way. We get to do both?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!

:'''Applejack''': [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?
:'''Gallus''': [inhale] Uh, yak?
:'''Yona''': [sniffing] Mm-hmm!
:'''Applejack''': Nope. Try again.
:'''Ocellus''': Um, apples?
:'''Applejack''': And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
:'''Applejack''': Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to ''my'' activity.

:[montage music]
:[hammering]
:[sawing]
:'''Applejack''': That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Emphasis on the slow.
:[whoosh]
:[thudding]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!
:[thud]
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa! No way!
:'''Rest of Young Six''': Whoa!
:'''Gallus''': Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
:'''Applejack''': Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose. [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, come on! These students are ''totally'' gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!
:'''Applejack''': No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done ''right''!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...

:[montage music continues]
:[wood creaking]
:[hammering]
:'''Applejack''': Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Little to the left...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, a hair to the right...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Now, a hoof shavin' higher...
:[creaking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] ''Just bring it down already!''
:'''Gallus''' and '''Smolder''': [yelps]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps]
:[crash]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles nervously]
:'''Applejack''': I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
:'''Yona''': Yak side! [grunts]
:[thud]
:'''Yona''': [chuckles nervously] Uh...
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Ocellus''': Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
:'''Applejack''': [growls]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
:[cricket chirping]
:'''Gallus''': Is that even a thing?
:'''Sandbar''': First I've heard of it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
:'''Yona''': Uh, Yona has questions.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
:'''Applejack''': You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
:[splashing]
:'''Yona''': Yak not like water.
:'''Ocellus''': Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle.
:'''Yona''': [weak whistling]
:'''Gallus''': We got you, Yona.
:'''Yona''': [yelping]
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We'll see about that.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!
:'''Applejack''': Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.
:'''Silverstream''': Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
:'''Smolder''': So... when do we get to the part when we move?
:[water splashing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': When everycreature starts listening to ''me'', the leader of ''my'' activity, ''Applejack''! Now stroke!
:[water splashing]

:[water rushing]
:[watch ticking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!
:'''Applejack''': Stop!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Go!
:'''Ocellus''': Which way do we go?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Left!
:'''Applejack''': Right!
:'''Silverstream''': Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Left! I can see the finish line from here!
:'''Applejack''': If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who cares about a few fish?
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, professors?
:'''Applejack''': You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
:'''Sandbar''': Guys?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We'll just go around them!
:'''Sandbar''': ''Rock!''
:'''All''': [screaming]
:[crash!]

:[water rushing]
:'''All''': [gasping, coughing]
:'''Silverstream''': [giggling]
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling] Oof! [grunting]
:[rip!]
:'''Silverstream''': I love field trips!
:'''Applejack''': I hope you're happy.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!
:[transformation zap]
:'''Ocellus''': That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling, coughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How's the canoeing... going?
:'''Smolder''': About as good as the apple shed building.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
:'''Applejack''': I did not!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did too!
:'''Applejack''': Did not!
:'''Gallus''': Yup. It's been like this all day.
:'''Sandbar''': I wouldn't say ''all'' day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We are! Mostly.
:'''Applejack''': We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!
:'''Applejack''': H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! ''You're'' the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.
:'''Applejack''': Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Field trip?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Right as rain and twice as fresh!
:[hoof-bump]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine. But ''I'm'' picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Right!
:'''Applejack''': See? We're agreein' already.

:'''Applejack''': Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?
:'''Smolder''': Ugh. Here we go again.
:'''Applejack''': Where to, Rainbow Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes ''you'' happy makes ''me'' happy.
:'''Applejack''': Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
:'''Applejack''': Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to ''you''.
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
:'''Applejack''': Hey! Where are y'all goin'?

:[montage music]

:'''Ocellus''': I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
:'''Sandbar''': Only because ''someponies'' won't make up their minds about which way to go.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] No, no. ''I'' insist.
:'''Applejack''': Heh. But ''I'' insisted first.
:'''Silverstream''': Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
:'''Smolder''': Ugh.
:[whoosh]
:'''Smolder''': We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Only if ''you'' want to build a bridge.
:'''Gallus''': ''Stop!'' Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
:'''Applejack''': Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cooperation!
:'''Applejack''': Togetherness!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You are so right!
:'''Applejack''': Only as right as you are!
:'''Smolder''': ''Okay!'' We'll build a bridge! What do we use?
{|
|
:'''Applejack''':
:Branches!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Vines!
|}
:[beat]
{|
|
:'''Applejack''':
:Vines!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Branches!
|}
:'''Applejack''': I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story!

:[montage music]

:'''Ocellus''': [yawns]
:[crickets chirping]
:'''Applejack''': [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
:'''Young Six''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': [grunting]
:'''Young Six''': [sighs]
:[crack]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping] ...easy to work with.
:'''Young Six''': [gasps]
:[wind whistling]
:'''Applejack''': [muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams]
:'''Applejack''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [screaming] Help!
:'''Ocellus''': Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something.

:[vines creaking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting] I can't get out!
:'''Applejack''': Let me try. [grunting]
:[vines creaking]
:[teeth snapping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
:[splashing]
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm.
:[teeth snapping]
:'''Applejack''': And they look mighty hungry.
:'''Sandbar''': We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
:'''Gallus''': Leave 'em hangin'?
:'''Silverstream''': What?!
:'''Gallus''': I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
:'''Ocellus''': We need to work fast! And together!
:[vines snapping]
:'''Smolder''': But mainly fast.
:'''Applejack''': I hate to admit it, but—
:[vines snapping]
:'''Applejack''': ...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
:'''Applejack''': So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I thought you'd never ask.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [screams]
:'''Ocellus''': Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ocellus?!
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
:[splashing]
:'''Ocellus''': [roars, chomp-chomp]
:[splashing]
:[vines snapping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [screaming]
:'''Silverstream''': Need a lift?
:'''Yona''': Yak smash! [grunting]
:'''Sandbar''': [grunting]
:'''Smolder''': [grunting]
:'''Yona''': [laughing, grunting]
:'''Sandbar''': Welcome back, professors!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now, ''that'' was a rescue!
:'''Applejack''': And y'all did it together!
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:'''Gallus''': No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
:'''Ocellus''': [growls]
:'''Gallus''': [screams]
:'''Ocellus''': [chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
:'''Silverstream''': [giggles] Best... field trip... ever!

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': Uhhhh...
:'''Yona''': Yak learn ponies smart!
:'''Silverstream''': Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
:'''Gallus''': It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what ''not'' to do so we'd figure out what we ''should'' do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Really...?
:'''Sandbar''': It took us a while to get it.
:'''Smolder''': Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
:'''Silverstream''': But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.
:'''Gallus''': Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
:'''Ocellus''': We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?
:'''Applejack''': To tell you the truth... yeah.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, not ''all'' the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
:'''Applejack''': Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You were the one doing the "angling"!
:'''Applejack''': [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!
{|
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!
|
:'''Applejack''':
:Look, we all live in the same town here...!
