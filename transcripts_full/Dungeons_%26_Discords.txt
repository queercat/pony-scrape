:'''Discord''': Tea?
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Discord''': Trendy coats? Bedrolls? Saddlebags? Oh! A surprise vacation just for the two of us? How thoughtful. I hear Puerto Caballo is lovely this time of year. Sand like powdered sugar. [blows]
:[sprinkling]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out.
:'''Discord''':''' '''[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
:'''Fluttershy''': If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac.
:'''Discord''': [laughs]
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': You aren't kidding.
:'''Fluttershy''': They're very nice. They have a "top secret" thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with them.
:'''Discord''': Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] "Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"
:'''Opposite Fluttershy''': ''Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!''
:'''Discord''': [snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?
:'''Fluttershy''': All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
:'''Discord''': Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.
:'''Fluttershy''': It never hurts to make new friends.
:'''Discord''': [scoffs] Consider it considered.
:[magic poof]
:'''Fluttershy''': [humming] [gasps]
:'''Discord''': Couldn't I just come with you instead?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Discord''': I suppose this is goodbye then. Have an absolutely fabulous voyage. [snap]
:[magic zap]
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord...
:'''Discord''': [gasps] Well, it's not ''my'' fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Oh, you're no fun. [snap]
:[magic zap]
:'''Applejack''': I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our resident Yakyakistan expert.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! I brought yeti food!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!
:[train whistle blows]
:[train chugging]
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?
:'''Spike''': I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Buh-bye!
:[train whistle blows]
:'''Applejack''': Bye, y'all!
:[train chugging]
:[train whistle]
:[long beat]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [unintelligible whispering]
:'''Spike''': [whispering] Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it...
:'''Big McIntosh''': [hushed] Yup.
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, ''please'' don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please— [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to.
:'''Spike''': Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?
:'''Discord''': [to himself] Oh, here we go...
:'''Spike''': Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?
:'''Discord''': Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.
:'''Spike''': [to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
:'''Discord''': A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?
:'''Spike''': Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two...
:'''Discord''': That does sound fun, actually...
:'''Spike''': Too bad you're busy.
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.
:[click]
:'''Discord''': [gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair.
:[magic zap]
:[rumble]
:'''Discord''': [normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness.
:'''Spike''': I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
:'''Discord''': Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.
:[magic zap]

:'''Spike''': And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!
:'''Spike''': It's guys' night.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Yup.
:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Yup.
:'''Spike''': Havin' fun now.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Yup.
:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Oh, yeah!
:[fanfare]
:'''Spike''': What the hay?
:[cartoon skedaddling]
:'''Mini-Discord''': [high-pitched] Announcing the much anticipated arrival of the spirit of chaos and disharmony, the purveyor of pandemonium, lord of lawlessness, earl of turmoil, bringer of bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!
:[electronic music playing]
:[confetti exploding]
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.
:'''Spike''': Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!
:'''Discord''': Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Oh, come on!
:'''Spike''': Uh... I'm talkin' about a ''real'' game.
:'''Discord''': Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.
:[Celestia's mane yowls]
:[magic zap]
:'''Spike''': Not exactly. Wait here.
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix.
:'''Spike''': [off-screen] Okay!

:[click]
:'''Spike''': In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... ''Ogres & Oubliettes''!
:'''Discord''': [gasps]

:'''Discord''': Oh, this looks like...
:'''Spike''': The best game ever? You're right!
:'''Discord''': Yes...
:'''Spike''': ''Ogres & Oubliettes'' is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [stifled laughter]
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': [chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land. He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much.
:'''Discord''': Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
:[zip!]
:'''Spike''': First things first – you've gotta create a character! Name?
:'''Discord''': How about... Discord?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.
:'''Discord''': Just like in real life?
:[crack]
:'''Spike''': And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.
:[hairdryer running]
:'''Discord''': [not listening] Go on, I'm listening.
:'''Spike''': Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!
:'''Discord''': [still not listening] I'm listening.
:'''Spike''': When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnope!
:'''Discord''': [clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
:'''Spike''': And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.
:[balloon deflating]
:'''Spike''': So, your character's name?
:'''Discord''': I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"?
:'''Spike''': Captain Wuzz it is!
:'''Discord''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...
:'''Discord''': [snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.
:'''Spike''': You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
:'''Discord''': Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
:[tok]
:'''Spike''': Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Spike''': Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you—
:'''Discord''': Oh, get on with it.
:'''Spike''': [rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': The bars exist in our ''imagination''.
:'''Discord''': Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?
:'''Spike''': It is real. In our ''imagination''. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
:'''Discord''': Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.
:'''Spike''': Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.
:[clang]
:'''Discord''': I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
:'''Spike''': That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad.
:'''Discord''': This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
:'''Spike''': You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
:'''Discord''': I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [chuckling] Parsnips. [laughs]
:'''Discord''': [growls]
:'''Spike''': The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.
:'''Spike''' and '''Big McIntosh''': [laughing]
:'''Discord''': Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [laughing]
:'''Spike''': [rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!
:'''Discord''': I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
:'''Spike''': I told you, you can't do magic!
:'''Spike''' and '''Big McIntosh''': [laughing]
:[magic zap]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
:'''Discord''': "Not intelligent enough." Please.
:'''Spike''': Cut it out, Discord!
:'''Discord''': Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a ''real'' guys' night!
:[snap]

:[upbeat jazz]
:'''Discord''': [laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!
:'''Spike''': I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!
:'''Discord''': I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] No, we want to go back to ''Ogres &''—
:'''Discord''': Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are ''very'' bad cards.
:'''Spike''': Stop messing with us! We wanna—
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': A dance contest?
:[upbeat jazz BGM]
:'''Discord''': Surprise! We won!
:'''Spike''': ''Discord!''
:'''Discord''': [sinister] Yes?
:'''Spike''': Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch.
:'''Discord''': Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?
:[magic zap]

:{{portray|Spike}}: Sir McBiggun?!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Eeyup!
:{{portray|Spike}}: And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!
:[magic zaps]
:[shings]
:{{portray|Spike}}: It's guys' night!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Eeyup!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Oh, yeah!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Yup!
:{{portray|Spike}}: In the game now!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Yup!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Oh, yeah!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Oh, yeah!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!
:'''Discord''': [reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
:[army marching]
:'''Squizard''': Behold! I am the Squizard!
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Big McIntosh}}: [gasps]
:'''Discord''': [reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
:'''Squizard''': Attack!

:[army shouting]
:{{portray|Spike}}: ''Run!''
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Big McIntosh}}: [panting]
:[arrows being fired]
:'''Discord''': [reverberating] ''You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well...'' [laughs] ''You get the idea.''
:[thud]
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Seventeen! Lucky you!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: [grunts]
:'''Discord''': Boo.
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Big McIntosh}}: [panting]
:'''Discord''': Boo.
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Big McIntosh}}: [screaming]
:{{portray|Spike}}: ''Discord!''
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you.
:[shing!]
:{{portray|Spike}}: This isn't funny!
:'''Discord''': Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? ''Like this?!''
:[magic zaps]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Ugh!
:[army shouting]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Spike}}: [groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Discord, this is awful!
:[magic zap]
:'''Squizard''': Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride!
:[beat]
:'''Squizard''': I mean, Shmarity.
:[magic zap]
:{{portray|Spike}} and '''Big McIntosh''': [gibbering]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Why are you doing this? You're the worst!
:'''Discord''': If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Because we felt bad for you!
:'''Discord''': Because you... ''what?!''
:[snap]

:[magic zap]
:'''Spike''': [panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to ''you'', Discord!
:'''Discord''': ''You'' felt sorry for ''me''?
:'''Spike''': Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!
:'''Discord''': This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm ''me'' and you're ''you''.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Discord''': I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of ''other'' friends I need to see tonight.
:'''Spike''': Good!
:'''Discord''': Yes, ''so'' many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad.
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Oh, well.
:[magic zap]
:'''Spike''': [sighs] It... it's better this way, right?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Spike''': Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Yup.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...
:'''Spike''': What?
:'''Discord''': I'm ssssssss—
:'''Spike''': Can't hear you.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nope.
:'''Discord''': I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?
:[magic zap]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [unintelligible whispering]
:'''Spike''': Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?

:[main cast chattering]
:[doors open]
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:[army shouting]
:{{portray|Spike}}: I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!
:[magic zap]
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Wha-hah!
:{{portray|Discord}}: [grunts]
:{{portray|Spike}}, {{portray|Big McIntosh}} and {{portray|Discord}}: [panting]
:'''Squizard''': [evil laughter]
:{{portray|Discord}}: [accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
:[magic zap]
:'''Squizard''': [squeaks]
:[crunch]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Bull's-eye!
:{{portray|Discord}}: Nice one!
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Discord}}: It's guys' night!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Eeyup!
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Discord}}: Oh, yeah!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Eeyup!
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Discord}}: Having fun now!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Eeyup!
:{{portray|Spike}} and {{portray|Discord}}: Oh, yeah!
:{{portray|Big McIntosh}}: Oh, yeah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Guys' night!
