:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, you really need to go to sleep!
:'''Spike''': Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about to—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "The Mane-iac"?
:'''Spike''': The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go ''completely insane''! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her ''all'' about it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hum Drum?
:'''Spike''': Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw.
:'''Spike''': Okay, okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
:[click]
:[patting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Two more minutes.
:'''Spike''': Yes!

:{{squarebrackets|[[theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You got it!
:'''Spike''': Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A little more to the left! No, the other left! [quickly] Awesome! That's perfect right where it is! On to the next painting!
:'''Spike''': You sure you don't need any help?
:'''Applejack''': Nah, that's okay.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [quickly] We have everything under control!
:'''Spike''': Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm good!
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Isn't there ''anything'' I can help you with, Twilight?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [quickly] Don't worry about it, Spike! It's all good!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?
:'''Spike''': Hum Drum ''never'' stops the villain. He's just there for comic relief. [splash and clatter] [grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!
:'''Spike''': ''I'' could do it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's okay, Spike.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Pony power! Weehee!!
:'''Spike''': [sigh]
:[bucket clatters]

:'''Spike''': [to himself] Mane-iac breaks into the museum... okay, here we go. ...Ugh, what a surprise! Hum Drum is in the way again while the Power Ponies do all the work! I guess I know what that feels like... [gasps] Wait. What? How can that be the end?! What's... that? "You can... retr-" What? "You can... return..." Urgh! I ''know'' I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here...
:'''Applejack''': Spike! Where are ya, Spike?
:'''Rarity''': We're breaking for tea and biscuits!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Spike!
:'''Spike''': [reading] "You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is... defeated." Huh? "Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book"? What does that even mean? Whoa! Cool!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! What are you—
:'''Spike''': ''Heeeeeelp!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! [straining noises]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [straining noises]
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rarity''': [gasps] [screaming]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Weehee!

:{{portray|Spike}}: Is this... Maretropolis?
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Holy new personas, ponies! You're the... Masked Matter-Horn! Fili-Second! Zapp! R-Radiance! Mistress Mare-velous! Saddle Rager! You're the... ''Power Ponies''!
:[thud]
:[whipping noises]
:'''Mane-iac''': Power Ponies! [laughs] How kind of you to join us!
:{{portray|Main cast}}: Huh?
:'''Mane-iac''': [evil laughter]

:'''Mane-iac''': [evil laughter]
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Did she just call us... ''Power Ponies''?
:{{portray|Spike}}: You're the... the superheroes from my comic book! It somehow zapped us all in here!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: So somepony zap us back out!
:{{portray|Spike}}: My comic book! It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac! Your ''arch-nemesis''!
:'''Mane-iac''': Time for the ''mane'' event!
:[crash]
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Pinkie! Where'd she go?!
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: Wheeeeeeee!
:{{portray|Spike}}: She could be miles away from here by now! Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis!
:[whipping noise]
:[clang]
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Whoa! [straining noises]
:'''Mane-iac''': [cackles]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Twilight! Freeze her mane!
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Do ''what''?
:{{portray|Spike}}: You're the Masked Matter-Horn! You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn!
:[magic fizzling out]
:'''Mane-iac''': You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this. [cackles]
:{{portray|Main cast}}: [gasps]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Dash! Quick! You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature! Unholster the lightning bolt!
:[electricity crackling]
:[lightning cracking]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Lightning, not a tornado!
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: [yelps]
:{{portray|Main cast}}: [yelping]
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: Whoa!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Whoa-whoa!
:{{portray|Main cast}}: [screaming]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Fluttershy! You're Saddle Rager! Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: Oh, gosh! That wouldn't... be very... polite!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Ugh! Rarity! Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!
:{{portray|Rarity}}: What's an attack construct?!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Just think of something, ''anything'', and your bracelet makes it appear!
:[smashing crockery]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Something ''useful''!
:[thud]
:{{portray|Spike}}: The Electro-Orb!
:'''Mane-iac''': Well, this has been quite the ''mane-raising'' experience. But I really must be going. [laughs]
:[thud]
:'''Mane-iac''': Why, thank you, Hum Drum! [evil laughter]
:[whipping noises]
:{{portray|Spike}}: I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no... [straining noises] Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city!
:{{portray|Applejack}}: But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!
:{{portray|Spike}}: You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!
:[lasso whipping]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: [giggles] That was spin-tastic!
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Lemme get this straight: We've been sucked into some kind of ''comic-book world''?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Almost all of us have superpowers...
:{{portray|Rarity}}: But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape!
:{{portray|Spike}}: Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless...
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then.
:{{portray|Spike}}: Yeah, good thing...
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?
:{{portray|Spike}}: Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Lead the way, Spike!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Then leave the rest to us!
:{{portray|Spike}}: [sighs]

:[neon light humming]
:{{portray|Spike}}: There it is!
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Is that a... shampoo factory?
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and—
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!
:[thunder crash]
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: So much for "element of surprise".
:{{portray|Spike}}: Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.
:[electricity crackling]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later.
:'''Mane-iac''': [evil laughter]
:{{portray|Rarity}}: She's home.
:[garage door opening]
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Time to Power Pony up!
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: Ooh! Nice catchphrase!
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Freeze ray!
:[thwap]
:{{portray|Rarity}}: It's an improvement, darling.
:[thud]
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: [giggles]
:[banging]
:[crash]
:{{portray|Rarity}}: Ooh, I do ''so'' love a functional accessory!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [whimpering]
:[lightning strikes]
:'''Henchpony''': My hair!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Seriously? You aren't even just a ''little'' angry right now?
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!
:'''Mane-iac''': I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time!
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Just watch us!
:{{portray|Spike}}: The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!
:[hairspray hissing]
:[clunk]
:{{portray|Rarity}}: We'll just see about that!
:[hairspray hissing]
:[ice cracking]
:[tink]
:'''Mane-iac''': [evil laughter]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!
:[hairspray hissing]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Don't spray!
:'''Mane-iac''': [cackles] Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on ''you''? Rather pointless, don't you think?
:{{portray|Main cast}}: [shouts of concern]
:[door slamming]
:[clang]

:{{portray|Spike}}: What am ''I'' supposed to do? I'm useless. No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. ''They're'' the ones with superpowers. They've probably already figured out how to escape.
:[clang]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Or not!
:[cracking]
:[timer ringing]
:[hairspray hissing]
:[cracking]
:'''Mane-iac''': Congratulations, Power Ponies! [laughs] You shall live just long enough to see me fire... the instrument of your destruction! [cackles] Once the Electro-Orb has powered it up completely, this cannon will amplify the power of my mane one ''million'' times, expelling an energy blast that will cause everypony in Maretropolis's mane to grow wild! [laughs] You will be my weapon's first victims, and there is nopony who can save you from this fate! [evil laughter]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: Ahem. I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?
:'''Mane-iac''': Hum Drum? Little guy? No superpowers whatsoever? [laughs] ''He's utterly useless''!
:[timer ringing]
:[hairspray hissing]
:'''Mane-iac''': ''Puh-lease''. Everypony knows you just keep him around because you [condescending tone] feel sowwy for him. Wah. Wah.
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Maybe in ''your'' world. But in ''our'' world, Spike— uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! ''Always''!
:'''Rest of Power Ponies''': [agreements]
:{{portray|Spike}}: I'm ''not'' like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I ''do'' come through! And they need me now!
:'''Mane-iac''': [laughs] I see dementia must be a side-effect of prolonged exposure to the Hairspray Ray of Doom. [laughs] Tonight, we stand upon the brink of immortality, for we collectively—though, mostly me—have finally defeated our most hated nemeses! We have hurled the brush of badness into the now fearful face of [laughs] goodness, and have struck a blow for freedom in the name of oppression! And ''nothing will stop us''! [laughs]
:[chain rattling]
:'''Henchponies''': [yelping]
:[whinny]
:[timer ringing]
:[chain rattling]
:[thwack]
:[hairspray hissing]
:{{portray|Twilight Sparkle}}: Way to go, Spike!
:[cracking]
:[clang]
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Get mad!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: I'm trying! [straining noises]
:{{portray|Pinkie Pie}}: Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it!
:'''Mane-iac''': Over ''there''! ''There''! ''There''! ''Idiots!''
:[ice cracking]
:[thud]
:[electricity crackling]
:[lightning crackling]
:{{portray|Rainbow Dash}}: Need a place to put ''these'' guys!
:[clanging]
:[thudding]
:{{portray|Applejack}}: Hold it right there, partner!
:[zapping]
:'''Henchponies''': [screaming]
:[Wilhelm scream]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Fluttershy, where are you going?
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: You seem to have everything under control.
:{{portray|Spike}}: Fluttershy, we need you! You have to power up!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad.
:[firefly buzzing]
:[smack]
:[firefly squealing]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: Oh, goodness! Are you okay? [to the Mane-iac] Are you ''kidding me''? I mean, I know you're evil and everything, but [getting frustrated] you hurt a teensy, ''little, harmless firefly''?! ''Really?!'' Well you're just a ''great, big, meanie!'' [voice getting deeper] ''There! I said it! What makes you think '''you're''' so special?! Like the rules of '''common courtesy''' don't apply to you?!'' [voice getting even deeper] ''Why don't you pick on '''somepony your own size?!''''' [roars]
:[controls buzzing]
:[laser firing]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [roars]
:'''Mane-iac''': [yelps]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [roaring]
:[smashing noises]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [spits]
:'''Mane-iac''': My mane! [laughs] My ''maaaaaane''! [laughs insanely]
:[thud]
:[electricity crackling]
:{{portray|Spike}}: Once again, the day is saved by—
:{{portray|Main cast}}: [yelping]

:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Awesome!
:'''Applejack''': Whoo-ee!
:'''Main cast''': [excited chattering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?!
:'''Applejack''': You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cupcakes?
:'''Rarity''': How did you—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!
:'''Spike''': I'm just glad to be back.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful.
:'''Spike''': And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend.
:'''Main cast''': ["Mm-hmm!", "Yeah!", "You got it!", general agreement]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book?
:'''Spike''': This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics. Well, I didn't know it meant they were ''literally'' enchanted!
:'''Main cast''': ["Aw, come on!", overlapping disbelief]
:'''Spike''': I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines! Hey, wait up! I'm an important part of this team, remember?!
