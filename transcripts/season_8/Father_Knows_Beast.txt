:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Woo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Spike''': Whoa! Ta-da!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember – two flaps, then straight up!
:'''Spike''': Got it!
:[flapping]
:'''Spike''': [grunts]
:[splash]
:'''Spike''': [inhales]

:[flapping]
:[bump]
:[thud]

:[crash]
:[fwip]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:[sloop!]
:'''Spike''': Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
:[crash]
:'''Spike''': [grunts] I don't know about "big", but I am definitely finished.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
:'''Spike''': No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.
:'''Smolder''': Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
:'''Spike''': What's the difference?
:'''Smolder''': Well, we don't have feathers, for starters.

:'''Spike''': Ye-he-he-hes!
:[hoof-bump]
:'''Spike''': Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
:'''Smolder''': Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff.

:[knock, knock]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more "dragonish" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?
:'''Spike''': Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this "thank-you" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.
:'''Smolder''': Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all.
:'''Spike''': What?
:'''Smolder''': Hey, what's that?
:'''Spike''': I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
:[crash!]
:'''Spike''': Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
:'''Sludge''': [groans, chuckles] Hey there, young dragons. [coughs] Name's Sludge. How are yours tails shakin'? [groans]
:'''Spike''': You all right?
:'''Smolder''': Yeah. What happened?
:'''Sludge''': To what?
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': Oh. I don't need to explain myself to a couple of baby dragons. [groaning and whimpering]
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': Ow...
:'''Spike''': Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
:'''Sludge''': Castle, eh? [groans]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Literally! There's a hole and everything!
:'''Sludge''': Well, I hope you're not expecting me to fix it. [groans]
:'''Applejack''': It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
:'''Sludge''': I'll manage. Dragons take care of themselves. I don't need help from a bunch of castle-livin' ponies. [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, do be careful.
:'''Sludge''': I'm... [groans] ...fine.
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': I can't watch!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?
:'''Spike''': And sometimes, even dragons need help.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.

:[sewing machine whirring]

:[cider press whirring]
:'''Sludge''': [sighs]
:[crash!]

:[doors creak]

:'''Sludge''': [sniffs]
:[clang!]
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]

:'''Sludge''': [chomp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better.
:'''Sludge''': T-Thanks, I guess.
:'''Rarity''': That's what friends are for, darling.
:'''Sludge''': You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid.
:'''Spike''': Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is...
:'''Spike''': Missing something deep down and dragonish.
:'''Sludge''': Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
:'''Applejack''': Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
:'''Sludge''': I wasn't gonna say anything since your life seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your father.
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [continues gasping] Sorry.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
:'''Sludge''': Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid.
:'''Spike''': Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Sludge''': [choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.

:[doors open]
:'''Spike''': I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
:'''Sludge''': Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for.
:'''Spike''': I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
:'''Sludge''': [stammers] You sure you don't want to ask something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.

:'''Sludge''': [voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
:'''Sludge''': You've been to Klugetown?
:'''Mane Six''': [various affirming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.
:'''Sludge''': Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-uh.
:'''Sludge''': [to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.

:'''Sludge''': [voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg.
:[clang!]
:'''Sludge''': [voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since.

:'''Sludge''': Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
:'''Spike''': Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
:'''Fluttershy''': Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm?
:'''Sludge''': I wish I had all the answers. [crying]
:'''Spike''': Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.

:'''Spike''': I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?
:'''Sludge''': Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?
:'''Spike''': Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.
:[scroll unrolls]
:'''Sludge''': Dude, you want to do all of this?
:'''Spike''': Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to.
:'''Sludge''': If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!
:'''Spike''': [gasps]

:[montage music]
:'''Granny Smith''': [blows whistle]
:'''Sludge''': [chomp, belches fire]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah!

:[wind whistling]
:[paper tearing]
:[paper tearing]

:[oven timer rings]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily]

:'''Sludge''': [gulps]
:'''Spike''': I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all ''my'' stuff. Is there anything ''you'' always wanted to do with ''me''?
:'''Sludge''': Not really.
:[beat]
:'''Sludge''': Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon.
:'''Spike''': Like a real dragon?
:'''Sludge''': Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
:'''Spike''': Huh?

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?
:'''Spike''': Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.
:'''Sludge''': Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.
:'''Spike''': You think that's something we can do?
:'''Sludge''': You know what, son? I think it is!
{{#lst:Just Can't Be a Dragon Here|song}}

:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
:'''Sludge''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
:'''Sludge''': [grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. ''Mi'' castle ''es su'' castle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.
:[door closes]
:[squeak!]
:[splattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
:'''Spike''': I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Outdoors?
:'''Spike''': Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!
:[door closes]

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...And that's why I thought we could use the map to—
:'''Spike''': Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.
:'''Sludge''': Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Isn't he the best?
:'''Rarity''': I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
:'''Sludge''': Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son.
:'''Spike''': Be right there... Dad.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
:'''Spike''': Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
:'''Spike''': What do you mean?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...
:'''Spike''': [scoffs] That ''is'' dragon culture.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''You'' never acted like that.
:'''Spike''': That's because ''you'' raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
:'''Spike''': Maybe you just don't like that I have a ''real'' parent now.
:[cracking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a—
:'''Spike''': Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe ''you'' would have a problem with that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:[splashing]
:[bushes rustling]
:'''Smolder''': What happened to you?
:'''Spike''': Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
:'''Smolder''': I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we ''have'' to live outside.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.
:'''Smolder''': What do you mean?
:'''Spike''': She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does.
:'''Smolder''': What?
:'''Spike''': Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.
:'''Smolder''': So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.
:'''Spike''': Huh. Now I'm really confused.
:'''Smolder''': Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?

:[door opens]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?
:'''Spike''': Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.
:'''Sludge''': [coughs] You what?!
:'''Smolder''': Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
:'''Spike''': That does sound perfect!
:'''Sludge''': No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here.
:'''Spike''': But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.
:'''Sludge''': It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
:'''Spike''': But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much.
::[singing] This bed is much too soft
::Just take that silk robe off
::We can't be dragons living here
:'''Sludge''' and '''Spike''': [straining]
:'''Sludge''': Stop! I'm not your father!
:'''Spike''': What?
:'''Sludge''': I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
:'''Spike''': So... you... pretended to be my dad?
:'''Sludge''': Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do.
:'''Smolder''': No. You didn't.
:'''Sludge''': Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. ''That's'' what dragons do.
:'''Smolder''': ''No''. It ''isn't''.
:'''Sludge''': You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Sludge''': I'm taking this pillow.
:'''Spike''': I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
:'''Smolder''': Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
:'''Spike''': That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Um, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
:'''Spike''': He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.
:'''Spike''': ''I'm'' the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.
:'''Spike''': I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aww! It's me, right?
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.
