:'''Trixie''': Come on, come on! Turn into a teacup!
:[magic zap]
:'''Trixie''': No! Teacup!
:[magic zap]
:'''Trixie''': No! ''Teacup!''
:[magic zap]
:'''Trixie''': [screeching] ''No''! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It could be because you're just yelling "teacup!" and not picturing it in your mind.
:'''Trixie''': Oh. Yeah, that could be it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
:'''Trixie''': [inhales]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Trixie''': Whoo! Starlight, I did it!
:[splurt]
:'''Trixie''': Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hey!
:'''Trixie''': Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!
:[splat]
:[teacup poodle yapping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:'''Trixie''': Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
:'''Trixie''': I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! ''Real'' magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] "Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.
:'''Trixie''': Oh! You need some snacks to give to Twilight? I've got you covered. [humming to herself]
:[splat]
:'''Trixie''': Problem solved.
:[magic rumbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [exhales] Not exactly.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[train whistle blows]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I am so excited for this friendship retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without having to save Equestria.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, we ''are'' awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
:'''Spike''': Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.
:'''Trixie''': [groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervous laughter]
:'''Trixie''': Kidding.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
:'''Trixie''': Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria ''is'' a friendship retreat, anyway?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.
:'''Trixie''': [giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [giggles] Shhh!
:'''Trixie''': Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You, too!
:[door shuts]
:[train rattling]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?
:'''Trixie''': Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller.
:'''Trixie''': No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.
:'''Trixie''': Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village.
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
:'''Trixie''': See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell—
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Teleportation spell.
:'''Trixie''': Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.
:'''Trixie''': Spike! How about it?
:'''Spike''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?
:'''Trixie''': I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]

:'''"Ginger Locks"''': [bored] Welcome to Manehattan Escapes.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, it's not ''that'' kind of retreat.
:'''Rarity''': Isn't it called "Manehattan Escapes" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
:'''"Ginger Locks"''': [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Team-building!
:'''Fluttershy''', '''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [sighs]
:'''Applejack''': Come on, girls. This could be fun.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm just happy to be with all of you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?
:'''"Ginger Locks"''': [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hah! Griffons barely like each other! We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!
:'''Trixie''': Challenge accepted!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
:'''Spike''': Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here.
:'''Trixie''': Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No, Trix, wait, not just—
:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:[thud]
:'''Trixie''': [weakly] Ta-da.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
:'''Trixie''': [clears throat] Teleport.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?!
:'''Trixie''': Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, we ''have'' to get that map back.
:'''Trixie''': We'll find it. No big deal.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
:'''Trixie''': Teleport, like you told me to.
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!
:'''Trixie''': [scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.

:[dishes clattering]
:[door opens]
:[crockery shattering]
:'''Spike''': Hey, are you okay?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
:'''Spike''': Wait, what?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go ''somewhere'', and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...
:'''Spike''': Hah. I remember that.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie.
:'''Spike''': Are you sure that's a good idea?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.
:'''Spike''': Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie!
:'''Trixie''': Oh, ''there'' you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered – you never get mad at me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?
:'''Trixie''': Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
:'''Trixie''': Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Did you remember?
:'''Trixie''': Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Cinnamon... nuts?
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's a good idea!
:'''Trixie''': Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [exhales] You got this, Starlight...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!
:[click, rattling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Applejack''': Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
:'''Applejack''': Don't both those fruits mean purple?
:'''Rarity''': Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
:[clunking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!

:'''Trixie''': [chewing]
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Ah, hello, fillies. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are those cinnamon nuts?
:'''Trixie''': Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': [stuttering] A big ta— Uh, no! Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha.
:'''Trixie''': Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?
:'''Trixie''': Sure!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?

:'''Granny Smith''': Nope, I ain't seen it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because ''somepony''...
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ...was craving apples.
:'''Trixie''': I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
:'''Granny Smith''': [sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Granny Smith, ''please''. The table?
:'''Granny Smith''': [confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done appeared out of thin air.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs]

:[teapot poodle yapping]
:'''Trixie''': Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and— Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind.
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.
:'''Trixie''': Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... "lch-bh-ba".
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:[magic warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [tired] Nope. I am great.
:'''Trixie''': Did your saddlebag just glow?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [weakly] No.
:'''Trixie''': Gimme!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [weakly] No!
:'''Trixie''': Give it here!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [weakly] Don't!
:'''Trixie''': What's in this?
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Cinnamon nuts!
:'''Granny Smith''': Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Uh, me, too! Ever since that Trixie came by with 'em.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [straining]
:[thud]
:[slow motion noise]
:[shattering]
:[dizzy stars]
:'''Trixie''': Um, why are they looking at me like that...?

:'''Bulk Biceps''': [growling]
:'''Trixie''': Whoa!
:'''Granny Smith''': You ruined my teacakes!
:'''Trixie''': What?! [anxious noises]
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': You just had to give Twilight those smelly pretzels!
:'''Trixie''': Were they ''your'' pretzels? I don't understand.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, can you help me, please?!

:'''Applejack''': Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?
:[bricks moving]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I've seen those symbols! Over here!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can do it!
:[clanking]
:'''Rarity''': Almost there.
:'''Fluttershy''': I've got the key!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is it! I'm so impressed.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm not. I knew we were the best!

:'''Granny Smith''': You're the worst!
:'''Trixie''': That seems harsh.
:'''Granny Smith''': Hiyaaa!
:'''Trixie''': Whoa! ''Starlight!'' [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!
:[magic fizzling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wish that Starlight was here to see how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work together! You've all taught me so much.
{{#lst:Best Friends Until the End of Time|song1}}
:'''Trixie''': Starlight! A spark of magic could be very helpful right about now!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [grunting] I can't...!
{{#lst:Best Friends Until the End of Time|song2}}
:'''"Ginger Locks"''': That was lovely. But, um, you know the game isn't over until you turn that key?
:[ding]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Gah!
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] Did we do it?
:[buzz]
:'''"Ginger Locks"''': So close. You missed the griffon record by two seconds. Probably shouldn't have sung that song.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, nuts!

:'''Bulk Biceps''': [screaming]
:'''Trixie''': ''Nuts!''
:[crash]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''You just do whatever you want to do!''
:'''Trixie''': Starlight!
:'''Granny Smith''': And you don't always... [pants] ...have to bring up my dark past!
:'''Trixie''': I didn't know you had one, Granny Smith!
:'''Granny Smith''': [grunts]
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Oh! I just can't believe you sometimes! You make me so mad!
:'''Trixie''': I barely even know you! I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [weakly] They're not. I am.
:[magic warbling and rumbling]
:'''Trixie''': You are?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we can't find that table, Twilight's ''never'' going to trust me again, and the worst part is ''you didn't even say you were sorry!''
:'''Trixie''': I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that would backfire.
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Aw, that's all right. It was a slow day.
:'''Granny Smith''': Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!
:[magic humming]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Yay! My nut cart!
:'''"Clarity Cut"''': Uh, hang on. Don't you work at the spa?
:'''Bulk Biceps''': [gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
:[cart squeaking]
:'''Trixie''': Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
:'''Trixie''': Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And a magical temper tantrum?
:'''Trixie''': Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the fact that you forgive me every time.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
:'''Trixie''': Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!

:[bell rings]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You're kidding me.
:'''Trixie''': There's more to it than that. I was thinking about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting – here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
:[thud]

:'''Spike''': A little to the left. Oh, now rotate it just a hair...
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, girls! How'd it go?
:[loud thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [simultaneously] Nothing!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...What?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud...
:'''Fluttershy''': We learned about team building and problem solving...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And when not to sing songs!
:'''Rarity''': We certainly had a good time, but I ''really'' was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sounds good to me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [simultaneously] I have a coupon!
:'''Rest of main cast''': [simultaneous agreement]
:'''Trixie''': We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table was there?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
:'''Trixie''': No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [giggling]
