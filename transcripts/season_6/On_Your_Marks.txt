:'''Apple Bloom''': Hear ye, hear ye! The first ''post''-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!
:[long pause]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [clears throat]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?
:'''Scootaloo''': I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw—
:[thump]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sighs] I guess not.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring...
:'''Apple Bloom''': [wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wow, you're right!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Exactly.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Like square dancing!
:[square dancing music]
:'''Scootaloo''': Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed! [same yodel over square dancing music]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Yeah!
:'''Apple Bloom''': And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Um... Apple Bloom?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Apple Bloom''': Wow... Did we really only ever do things ''just'' to get our cutie marks?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't know. Maybe?
:'''Scootaloo''': Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Of course we did!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Absolutely!
:[montage music]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?
:'''Apple Bloom''': We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Helping other ponies!
:'''Scootaloo''': Ponies without cutie marks!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': But are you sure you feel content?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Scootaloo''': Not even a ''tinge'' of dissatisfaction?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Not even the ''slightest'' naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
:[thump]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.

:'''Apple Bloom''': The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.
:'''Scootaloo''': The three of us tried for the ''longest'' time, but it just comes when it comes!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
:'''Scootaloo''': So if you're having even the slightest problem...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ...or concerns or questions...
:'''Apple Bloom''': ...we want you to know that we are here to help.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.
:'''Pound Cake''' and '''Pumpkin Cake''': [babbling]

:[montage music]

:[scrolls unrolling]
:[door opens]
:[door shuts]

:[bits jingling]

:[bubblegum popping]

:'''Apple Bloom''': This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?
:'''Scootaloo''': Kinda makes you wonder why ''we'' made such a big deal out of it for so long.
:[beat]
:'''Scootaloo''': What?
:'''Apple Bloom''': The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But if we can't find anypony with a problem...
:'''Scootaloo''': ...Maybe ''we're'' not special.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Yeah!'' I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. ''I'' have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle.
:[beat]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': What?

:'''Bulk Biceps''': I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!
:'''Scootaloo''': [straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr... um... Bulk.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!
:'''Apple Bloom''': A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!
:'''Scootaloo''': No matter how long it takes!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Or how hard it is!
:'''Apple Bloom''': We'll solve it because that's what we do!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Yeah! [straining]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Yeah!''
:'''Sweetie Belle''': So... what's your cutie mark problem?
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!
:'''Scootaloo''': [nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?
:'''Bulk Biceps''': You mean, not dumbbells?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yeah!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yeah!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Yeah!''
:[crunch]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. ''You guys are awesome!''
:[crunch]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yeah!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah!
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Yeah!'' Wow, you three really have a knack for this!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That ''was'' easy!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Maybe ''too'' easy.
:'''Scootaloo''': What do you mean?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And...?
:'''Apple Bloom''': And what if we never find another one?
:'''Scootaloo''': Well...
:'''Apple Bloom''': And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': So...?
:'''Apple Bloom''': So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': The problem boils down to this – we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Right! And—
:'''Scootaloo''': Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So...
:[map unfurling]
:'''Apple Bloom''': I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!
:'''Scootaloo''': That kinda seems like a lot.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!
:'''Scootaloo''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': Hoof!
:'''Apple Bloom''': But... what do we do ''until'' then?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Maybe whatever we want?
:'''Apple Bloom''': What do you mean?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to.
:'''Apple Bloom''': So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!
:'''Scootaloo''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': Sure am!

:'''Apple Bloom''':
:Makin' potions!
|
:'''Scootaloo''':
:Scootering!
|
:'''Sweetie Belle''':
:Singing!

:'''Scootaloo''': Just remember – stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!
:'''Apple Bloom''': If you say so.
:'''Scootaloo''': Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo!
:[tires screeching]
:'''Scootaloo''': Ta-da!
:[thump]
:[thump]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': [blows pitch pipe] Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony.
:'''Scootaloo''': Harmony, huh?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [tapping with baton] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!

:'''Sweetie Belle''':

:Do...

:'''Apple Bloom''':
:[off-key]
:So...!

:'''Scootaloo''':
:[''very'' off-key]
:''Mi!''
|}
:'''Scootaloo''': Wow, that ''was'' simple!
:[snap]

:'''Apple Bloom''': It's just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!
:[clink]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!
:[poof]
:[clink]

:'''Apple Bloom''': ...and even though Scootaloo thinks bungee jumping is the bee's knees...
:[pen squeaking]
:'''Apple Bloom''': ...Sweetie Belle would rather ''keep'' bees.
:[pen squeaking]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [spits] Of course, I'm allergic. Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together?
:'''Scootaloo''': Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Didn't what?
:'''Scootaloo''': Do things together. Well, do ''everything'' together.
:'''Apple Bloom''': But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
:'''Scootaloo''': And we always will be! But I ''really'' wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet.
:'''Scootaloo''': Isn't there something ''you've'' always wanted to do on your own?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.
:'''Scootaloo''': That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I guess...
:'''Scootaloo''': Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!
:'''Apple Bloom''': But I don't know what it'll be.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You'll find something!
:'''Scootaloo''': Something awesome!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sighs] Well... I guess now I have to.
{{#lst:Out On My Own|song}}
:'''Hoofer Steps''': [muffled] And ''one'', two, three, four, ''two'', two, three, four, ''one'', two, three, four, ''two'', two, three, four—
:[door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?
:'''Hoofer Steps''': Well, let's see what you can do. We have a recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up! [hushed] Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step into a partnered routine...
:'''Apple Bloom''': That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!
:'''Hoofer Steps''': Well then! Dancing with partner will be perfect. [claps]
:[slow tango music]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Whooooooa!
:[faster tango music]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Whoa, whoaaa!
:[sound of skittles being knocked over]
:[thump]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends.
:'''Hoofer Steps''': Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist.

:'''Hoofer Steps''': Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I ''don't'' want.
:[door opens]
:'''Tender Taps''': Sorry it didn't work out.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's ''just'' terrible.
:'''Tender Taps''': You weren't that bad. You just need to learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun! [tap dancing] Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling!
:[beat]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital.
:'''Tender Taps''': Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you.
:'''Tender Taps''': You, too. [tap dancing]

:'''Scootaloo''': Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even ''more'' than scootering!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ''Seriously?!'' That's amazing! Look what I did!
:'''Scootaloo''': Wow, uh, that's, um...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] "Crochet is knitting's poorer cousin", [normal] but I ''loved'' it!
:'''Scootaloo''': Awesome!
:[door creaks open]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your ''own'' interests?
:'''Scootaloo''': Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? ''Nothin'!''
:[blind snaps up]
:'''Scootaloo''': You tried every one of these?
:'''Apple Bloom''': And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!
:'''Scootaloo''': Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do ''everything'' together.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.
:'''Scootaloo''': I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!
:'''Scootaloo''': And being good doesn't always mean you will.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?

:[door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': You're here!
:'''Shoeshine''': Shhhh!
:[audience cheering]
:[door opens]
:'''Tender Taps''': What are you doing here?
:'''Apple Bloom''': You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage!
:[piano playing]
:'''Tender Taps''': Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed, but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What if I'm bad?!
:'''Apple Bloom''': We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me.
:[audience cheering]
:'''Tender Taps''': [sighs] All right, I'll do it. But I don't have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time to change it!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Leave everything to us.

:'''Tender Taps''': [nervously] I don't know about this...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Don't worry, you'll be just fine!
:[piano stops playing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Here goes nothin'...
:[clunking]
:[audience member coughs]
:'''Tender Taps''': [gulps]
:[jazz-type music starts]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [clunky tap dancing]
:[thump]
:[audience laughing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Can't be any worse than I was!
:'''Tender Taps''': [tentatively, then progressively more confident tap dancing] [heavy breathing]
:[pause, then audience cheering]
:[cutie mark zap]

:'''Tender Taps''': I can't believe it! It's just what I always imagined it would be! And if it weren't for all of you, I wouldn't even have it.
:'''Scootaloo''': No problem!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': It's what we do.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason...
:'''Tender Taps''': Well, either way, I hope you keep dancing. [short tap-dancing burst]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!
:'''Tender Taps''': Or find out I needed help!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!
:'''Scootaloo''': And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Or my crochet to make the costumes!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Yeah!
