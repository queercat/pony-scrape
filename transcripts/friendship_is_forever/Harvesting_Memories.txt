:'''Spike''': We just need you to get Twilight to remember some of her favorite times with you so this book can record them.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But it's a surprise gift for her coronation, and I know you're uncomfortable not telling the truth, soooo...
:'''Applejack''': It's true I ain't fond of lyin', but I think I can handle it in my own way.
:'''Spike''': Just to play it safe, let's practice our way first.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [imitating Twilight Sparkle] Oh, hi there, Applejack! It's always so great to see you! But why did you ask me to come out to the farm?
:'''Applejack''': Uhhh... You see, the thing is, I need you to, uh... check the apples? I-I mean, I definitely don't need you to reminisce about some memorable times with me for any kind of magical gift or anything! [laughs nervously] Nope!
:'''Spike''': Maybe it's better if I do the talking.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not sure I understand, Spike. Why would Applejack need ''me'' to check the apples she's using for the coronation?
:'''Spike''': I'm sure she just wants everything to be perfect. Isn't that right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Well, uh, yes. But I have to be honest, Twilight. I—
:'''Spike''': Speaking of honesty, what's your favorite time that Applejack was honest, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gee, Spike, that's an odd question. And there's been a lot.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''': Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack! What do I do?!
:'''Applejack''': Let go.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you ''crazy''?!
:'''Applejack''': No, I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not true!
:'''Applejack''': Now, listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yaaah!

:'''Applejack''': Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.
:'''Photo Finish''': Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!
:'''Applejack''': Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?

:'''Applejack''': I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''"Jinx"''': But you gave it your stamp of approval!
:'''Rainbowshine''': Are you saying you lied?
:'''Applejack''': ...I am.
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Applejack''': I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust.

:'''Applejack''': [laughs] I am pretty honest.
:[chicken clucks]
:'''Spike''': Yup. But you weren't always that way, were ya?
:'''Applejack''': [nervous sound]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I've heard that story.

:'''Granny Smith''': Now apple blight is a serious disease!
:'''"Doctor Spring Bud"''': [splutters] Did she say... apple blight?
:'''"Open Heart"''': I think she said "gasket mites".
:'''Granny Smith''': And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches.
:'''Filthy Rich''': [gasps] Oh, no! Granny!
:'''"Open Heart"''': Did you say..."prune them branches"?
:'''Granny Smith''': Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?
:[cloth moving]
:[scare chord]
:[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
:'''Young Applejack''': ''Everypony, just stop!'' This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big ''lie''.
:[cloth moving]
:[doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
:'''Granny Smith''': Big Mac?!
:'''Filthy Rich''': [gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!
:'''Granny Smith''': That is a darn good question.
:'''Young Applejack''': [sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it.
:'''Filthy Rich''': So Granny was never sick?
:'''Granny Smith''': And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?
:'''Young Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.
:'''Young Applejack''': Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more.
:"'''Hippocratic Oath'''": So she's not a doctor?
:'''Young Applejack''': Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is ''my'' fault.

:'''Applejack''': I reckon what really set me against lyin' was seein' how it affected my family. And you're about as close to family as a pony can get, Twilight. That's why I need to—
:'''Spike''': That's another thing I love about you, Applejack. Nopony loves her family more than you do. Right, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sure. The Apples are all pretty close.

:'''Applejack''': Found 'em!
:'''Granny Smith''': Aaa-choooo!
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Gesundhoof.
:'''Granny Smith''': Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday.
:'''Applejack''': Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then.
:'''Granny Smith''': Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Everypony!
:'''Granny Smith''': ''Everypony?'' [aside, to Applejack] Feathers on a goat. [to Apple Bloom] Are you sure?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!
:'''Granny Smith''': Guh?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!
:'''Granny Smith''': I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough.

:'''Applejack''': Everypony knows all this stuff about me. But I have something to say—
:'''Spike''': Ah, just look at me rambling on and on! You brought Twilight here to check the apples, and we haven't even started. Come on, Twilight!
:[door slams]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Applejack, are you trying to ruin the surprise?
:'''Applejack''': I don't see how I could. Spike won't let me get a word in edgewise!
:'''Spike''': I think—

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': The way Spike's getting Twilight's memories might seem dishonest, but it's working really well.
:'''Applejack''': Don't you think Twilight'll get a mite suspicious if I just stand around while Spike does all the talkin'?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I suppose you should say something, but it doesn't have to be a lie. You can talk about anything. We just need more memories.
:[door creaks]
:'''Applejack''': What do you think?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think I still don't know what I'm supposed to be checking. You and your family have been running this farm forever. You know apples better than I ever will.
:'''Applejack''': I, uh... I guess that's true. We have been on this farm for quite a while. This barn's been here a while, too. Though it almost wasn't.

{{#lst:Raise This Barn|song}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What made you tell ''that'' story?
:'''Applejack''': Um... I suppose bein' in the barn made me think of it. Is that weird?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not any more than the way you used to do your chores.
:'''Spike''': I've never heard that story.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you talking about? You were there!

:'''Applejack''': I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!
:[pigs squeal]
:[pigs stampeding]
:'''Applejack''': I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?

:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah! I don't know how I could've forgotten that. Come to think of it, for a down-to-earth farm pony, you are weird a lot.

:'''Applejack''': [reading] "And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, 'Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore.' So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The end."
:'''Rarity''': Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?

:'''Rarity''': [in country accent] Who's our next model for the fashion show?
:'''Spike''': Um... "Apple... Jewel"?
:'''Rarity''': Who the hay is that?
:[tango music]

:'''Applejack''': [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
:[Spike and Twilight gasp]
:'''Applejack''': It's a curse, I tells ya!

:'''Apple Bloom''': Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who ''really'' loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?
:'''Apple Bloom''': [growls]

:'''Shining Armor''': Applejack? What are you doing?
:'''Applejack''': Applejack? [laughs] Who's that? ''My'' name's Apple Chord, and I've got a couple of songs to play for ya. Clap your hooves if you know 'em! And a one, and a two, and a...
::My love is like a barrel
::A barrel full of hay

:'''Applejack''': I guess I can be just as peculiar as the next pony. But that's not what's goin' on here today.
:'''Spike''': Uh, because today you wanted Twilight to check over the apples for the coronation, right?
:'''Applejack''': Nnnope. And I think it's time I told you the truth.
:[chicken clucks]

:'''Applejack''': Twilight, I have to be honest. The reason Spike gave you for comin' out to the farm today was a lie. It's just that things have been so hectic, what with savin' Equestria and planin' for the coronation. I just wanted to have a chance to reminisce with you for a bit.
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs]
:[chicken clucks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm happy to spend time remembering things we've done together. You don't have to make up some excuse for that. Let's see... My favorite Applejack memories...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My name is Twilight Sparkle—
:'''Applejack''': Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friends? Actually, I—
:'''Applejack''': So, what can I do you for?
:'''Spike''': [snickering]

:'''Applejack''': Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?
:'''Applejack''': Oh, just ''dandy''. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'd like to help.
:'''Applejack''': Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just give me a ''chance''.
:'''Applejack''': Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [struggle] Ugh... [struggle] Ugh... [gasp]
:'''Spike''': ''Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I ''could'' use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
:'''Applejack''': Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
:'''Spike''': That's my girl, following my advice.
:'''Applejack''': And what in tarnation does that mean?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. ''Slow down''!
:'''Spike''': [yelp]
:'''Spike''' and '''Applejack''': Whoa-oa-oa!
:'''Applejack''': What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?

:[doors close]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughing] It's funny, really. Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along. Too bad the rest of you were too caught up in your wedding planning to realize those suspicions were correct! [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've always been such a good friend. I don't know what I would have done without you.
:'''Applejack''': I feel the same way. If I hadn't met you, I might not have ever left the farm or had any adventures at all.

:[city noises]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!
:'''Applejack''': [gulps]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, are you all right?
:'''Applejack''': Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home. [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open.
:'''"Rivet"''': [blows police whistle]
:'''Rarity''': Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!
:'''"Rivet"''': [blows police whistle]
:'''Rarity''': Yoo-hoo!
:'''Applejack''': [snorts]
:'''Diamond Cutter''': Move it!
:'''Applejack''': Sorry 'bout that.
:'''Strawberry Ice''': Ah, get outta my way!
:'''Applejack''': Sorry.
:'''Pedestrian Ponies 3 & 4''': Watch it!
:'''Applejack''': Hey— Oh, dear. Butter my biscuits. I can barely cross the street in this town.

:[train chugging]
:[brakes hiss]
:[train chugging]
:[wind whistling]
:'''Applejack''': Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe they know something we don't?
:'''Applejack''': Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca—
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [scream]
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': I'm sorry.
:'''Fluttershy''': [screams] You really startled us.
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!
:'''Applejack''': We get the picture. Why?
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': Nothing but uncharted terrain and wild beasts out that way. [maniacal laughter]
:'''Applejack''': Well, maybe there's a ''little'' somethin' to be scared of.

:'''Chimera''': [growls, bleats, and hisses]
:'''Chimera's tiger head''': Where are the pies?!
:'''Chimera's snake head''': They're not back here.
:'''Chimera's goat head''': This is ''your'' fault! You think you've always got to be in charge!
:'''Chimera's tiger head''': [sighs] You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh, actually...
:'''Chimera's goat head''': Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!
:'''Chimera's snake head''': [hisses] Any lassst wordsss?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I really wish my sister were here!
:'''Applejack''': Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!
:'''Chimera's tiger head''' and '''goat head''': Get her!
:'''Chimera's goat head''': Hey! I thought I was in charge now!
:'''Chimera's tiger head''': [growls]
:'''Applejack''': [plays snake charming flute]
:'''Chimera's snake head''': [hisses]
:'''Chimera's tiger head''': [growls] [roars]
:'''Applejack''': Howdy!
:[stretching noise]
:[smash]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I feel pretty lucky we're friends.
:'''Applejack''': Honestly, so do I.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you were right about the coronation keeping me busy. Come on, Spike. Celestia and Luna want to go over the guest list. Again.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guess Spike and I should've let you handle things from the start.
:'''Applejack''': I may be an honest pony, but even I know how to not spoil a surprise.
