:'''Spike''': Okay, Spike. You know you might get distracted by the stacks of books and copious charts, so remember what to say. "Twilight, I know you're in full prep mode for Trivia Trot tomorrow, but you need to get some sleep!" Huh. [laughs] Nice work. You got this.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': [gasps] This is weird.
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Twilight! What are you doing?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great question, Spike! And the answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...going to bed! Brains need eight hours of sleep to perform at optimum levels!
:'''Spike''': Oh. Cool. I thought I'd have to force you to go to bed since tomorrow is your chance to be the first pony to win Ponyville Trivia three times in a row. That is tomorrow, right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...yes! Ask me another one.
:'''Spike''': Another what?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Another question! I want to stay in the zone. That way, I can sleep in the zone! Wake up in the zone! And be totally in the zone tomorrow!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Uh, this is a whole new level of "Twilight-ing", isn't it? Heh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...yes!
:'''Spike''': Are you okay?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...''yes!''
:'''Spike''': Well, good night, Twilight. Good luck with your brain sleep and getting that third win. [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...good night! And yes!
:'''Spike''': That wasn't a question.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you decided to come watch your first Trivia Trot, Spike. I hope the rules aren't too confusing.
:'''Spike''': Rules? Isn't trivia just asking questions and answering them?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] The Trot is a little more involved than that. Let's start with the first category of rules. [reading] "Categories. Rule one: Each category must be categorically designated and thoroughly researched in all categorical..."

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "...participating in Trivia Trot." And that wraps up rule forty-one point six. Of course, the exception to that – rule forty-one point six A – is interesting itself because—
:'''Spike''': Oh, look! We're here!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! I can't wait to see who my partner's gonna be!
:'''Spike''': You don't get to pick your own team?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule twenty point one six B, Spike. To keep things fair, the teams are randomly selected.
:'''Spike''': [sarcastically] Twenty point one six B. How could I forget?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And based on the regular attendees, I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus my percentage of winning with each one!
:'''Spike''': Ha! I knew there'd be a chart! Glad I'm just watching. I don't think I could handle being your teammate. What if I let you down?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] You could never let me down, Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the support I can get for win number three!
:[door opens]
:[indistinct conversations]
:'''Applejack''': Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ. Think you can win again this week, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!
:[door opens]
:'''Sunburst''': We'll just see about that! I didn't come all the way from the Crystal Empire to lose. And I hope you realize I have the highest percentage of correct answers, and I aim to keep it that way.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whickers] I hope ''you'' realize not every category is gonna be "Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them".
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'. [giggles]
:'''Angel''': [chitters angrily]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, that was a category last week.
:'''Maud Pie''': It won't be in the game tonight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure sounded like a joke to me! [giggles] Woo-hoo!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie Pie?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Present!
:[dramatic musical sting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panicked muttering]
:'''Spike''': What's wrong, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off! I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good for a Trivia Trot three-peat!
:'''Spike''': Do I have to do that thing where I list all your successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and remind you this is just a game?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is ''not'' just a game! This! Is! ''Trivia Trot!''
:[tapping]
:'''Granny Smith''': Okay, settle down, everypony. I'm fixin' to pick these here teams.
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?
:[teleportation zap]

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': What'd I miss?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Granny's about to call out the fifth team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been paired with Cranky Doodle!
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [mumbles, muttering] What? Who's that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.
:'''Applejack''': [growls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Let's do this! Yeah!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.
:'''Granny Smith''': All righty, hold on to your horseshoes, 'cause the next pair of players is... Maud and Mudbriar!
:[crowd groans]
:'''Spike''': What's wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maud and Mudbriar have been paired together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be fine if they weren't so good.
:[sizzling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!
:'''Granny Smith''': And our final pair of contestants for this week's Trivia Trot is... Twilight and Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight! It's you and me! Isn't that great?
:[clatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah. Great.

:'''Spike''': So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight! I can't believe we're partners for a game! I love games! And I'm super duper excited for ''this'' game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever! Ooh! We could be Team Twinkie! Or [gasps] Team Pink-Light! [gasps] Sparkle Pie! No-no-no-no! [gasps] Twi-Pie! [squee]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You don't have anything to worry about. I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.
:[bell ringing]
:'''Spike''': So... still think you can win?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [exhales] I know I can. Pinkie might not be the partner I expected, but I can coach her along. And besides, I'm pretty good at this game. If she misses a few, I'm sure I can pick up the slack.
:[airhorn blows]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's get this party started!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously]

:'''Granny Smith''': Now, the first order of business is we need somepony to keep score.
:'''Spike''': I'll do it!
:'''Applejack''': [laughs] I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike. The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.
:'''Sunburst''': Yeah. Starlight used to do it, but now... Well, I can't even say the word "trivia" around her.
:'''Granny Smith''': [scoffs] Apple mash. Don't let them scare ya. You'll be fine. Now, let the games begin!
:[crowd cheers]

:'''Applejack''':
:Get ready to get squashed! Hey, don't copy me!

:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Get ready to get squished! Hey, don't copy me!
|}
:'''Granny Smith''': The first category is "Literary Figures".
:[crowd groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! A category about books! We're off to a great start!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Granny Smith''': [clears throat] Who is the pony that despises the holiday season in the old classic ''A Hearth's Warmin' Tale''?
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The answer is nopony! Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!
:[beat]
:'''Granny Smith''': Well, as much as that ain't exactly wrong, it ain't exactly right neither.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whines]
:'''Spike''': Just doing my job, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry. I didn't know we could have negative points.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's fine, Pinkie. But maybe it'll help our chances if I coach you as we go. Tip one – try sitting still.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can do, Coach Twilight—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And don't get distracted. Or ''be'' distracting. Oh, and remember to listen carefully. Also, it's best to keep quiet between questions.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Got it.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...! [continues under]
:'''Granny Smith''': Which topographical locale used to be a cavern, but after thousands of years of erosion, is now a gorge?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?!
:[bell rings]
:'''Maud Pie''': The answer is the Ghastly Gorge.
:'''Granny Smith''': That is one hundred percent correct!
:'''Applejack''': [chomp]
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is "Apples"!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rigged!
:'''Applejack''': I didn't hear ''you'' complain when the category was "Wonderbolt History".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But... [stutters] that-that's totally different!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, Pinkie. Remember, the category is "Apples". Keep your mind on apples.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apples, apples, apples, apples... Ooh, and oranges. And grapes! And strawberries. [gasps] Strawberry cupcakes! I'm hungry.
:'''Granny Smith''': Which variety of apple only blooms for five days?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughs] Don't choke. [whistles]
:'''Applejack''': Now, why would I choke on a question about apples? Uh... What was the question again?
:'''Granny Smith''': You kiddin' me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Come on, Pinkie, you know this one. Mysterious apples? Only around for five days?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[stomach growls]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Quiet down there. Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.
:[bell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?
:'''Granny Smith''': Finally! Yes, Fluttershy, it is. At least ''somepony'' here knows her apples.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Yeah!
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [weak laugh]
:[stomach growls]

:'''Spike''': One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break—! Aah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! I don't think I can coach Pinkie well enough for us to get my three-peat! I don't want her to feel bad! She's trying so hard, but I might have to start answering everything myself!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Look, Twilight! No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie! [chomps, gulps]
:'''Spike''': Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how ''you're'' playing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or... I should look at how everypony else is playing.
:'''Granny Smith''': Hope you're all in your seats 'cause the break is over, and it is time for more questions. [muttering] Let me see, uh... How do you say "reward" in Olde Ponish?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[smack!]
:[bell rings]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [snoring]
:'''Sunburst''': "Reward" in Olde Ponish is "''hliet''".
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Sleeping!''
:[crowd muttering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat] Sunburst's partner is sleeping. And according to rule fifty-seven point six, sleeping on the table is subject to dis-qual-i-fi-ca-tion!
:'''Granny Smith''': Oh, looky here. That's an actual rule. Cranky is disqualified. I'm sorry, Sunburst. Without your teammate, you can't play neither.
:'''Sunburst''': Aw, fine! But I'm counting that as a correct answer! [groans] Can't even stay awake for five minutes...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry, Pinkie. We're not out of this game yet.

:'''Angel''': [whispering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:[bell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': Is the answer carrots?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah! Rule thirteen point two! No help from pets!

:'''Applejack''': Nyah!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nyah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule seventy-two point eight! No sticking tongues out at opponents!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Motion to establish new rule! No expressionless contestants!
:'''Granny Smith''': Nice try.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine.
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is... "Cupcakes"!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Twilight! I know all about those! You have to let me help!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [exhales heavily] Suuuure! Just when we're finally back in the game! [laughs crazily] Why, that sounds perfect, Pinkie, but... Ooh! Isn't that a confetti appreciation parade I see?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Where?!
:[zip!]
:'''Granny Smith''': What flavor cupcakes did Princess Celestia order for Princess Luna's surprise birthday party last year?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait, what?!
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Double midnight chocolate fudge with chili pepper frosting!
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! I knew that! I made those cupcakes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Pinkie. But you were looking at the parade, and I didn't want our team to miss out on the point.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?

:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': 1547 Pony B.E.!

:[smack!]
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Vanhoover!

:[splat]
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Cutie Pox!

:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Bananaaaaas!''

:'''Granny Smith''': The category is "Sticks and Stones".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [brays] I don't know anything about those! That's not any kind of category!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it's a kind of category where ''we'' know the answers and ''you'' don't.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie. I grew up on a rock farm. I'm sure I know some of these.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating faster]
:'''Granny Smith''': What kind of stone can be used to start a fire?
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The black one!
:'''Maud Pie''': The answer is flint.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, that one! We both get points, right?
:'''Sunburst''': Sorry, Pinkie. Rule four – answers must be specific and exact. I'd help you if I could. I know this category pretty well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gee, Pinkie! I forgot the name of that famous rock in Griffonstone. Could you ask Maud?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You got it! Hey, Maud! What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?
:'''Maud Pie''': Pinkie, you can't ask me that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure I can. I just did.
:[crowd muttering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Granny Smith''': You can't go and ask another player about rocks when that's the category. It's in the rulebook. Where's... Sorry, Pinkie, but you're disqualified.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?!
:[loud thud]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I-I can't believe I'm disqualified! [whines]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously] I'm sorry, Pinkie. Guess I forgot about that rule.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! If I'm out, you don't have a partner! You won't be able to get your third win!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified...
:'''Sunburst''': Rule nineteen point seven B, whereby players whose teammates were disqualified may form a new team.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Okay. Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.
:[balloons deflate]
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is "Ancient Legends".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, we're gonna crush this round!
:'''Sunburst''': I don't know, Twilight. You seem out of the zone today. But don't worry. I can pick up the slack.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! I am the reigning Trot champ! If there's any slack that needs picking, I'll be the up! I mean, wait...
:'''Sunburst''': I'm just saying you seem a little frazzled, and I do have a correct answer percentage to maintain.
:'''Granny Smith''': Who traveled to Equestria from a distant land seeking to steal the magic from its pony inhabitants?
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That would be Lord Tirek!
:[bell rings]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, that answer is incomplete. The answer is Lord Tirek ''and'' Scorpan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But Scorpan tried to convince Tirek ''not'' to do it, so technically he wasn't part of it, even if he started out—! [groans] Never mind.

:[montage music]
:[bell rings]

:[bell rings]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Look, Sunburst. I realize I may have been a little off earlier, but I'm really good at this game.
:'''Granny Smith''': How many holes are there in Daring Do's hat?
:[bell rings]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twenty!
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha!
:'''Sunburst''': Twilight, I knew that one! You just cost us a point ''and'' the correct answer I needed to boost my percentage!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I knew it, too. You're not the only pony to ever read a book, you know?
:'''Sunburst''': You're right, Twilight. I'm sorry. But now that I think about it, I'm not so sure about Dash's answer. Could you do a quick fact check?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I know it's twenty. But if you want proof... Wait! According to rule eighteen point three, I can't check outside reference material.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Are you trying to get me disqualified?! What kind of pony would do that to their own teammate?!
:'''Sunburst''': You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. I was so focused on my correct answers, I wasn't thinking straight. Can you forgive me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's okay, Sunburst. I understand. And I have a teammate of my own to apologize to. Lucky for you, Cranky's awake. And according to rule fifty-seven point six B...
:'''Sunburst''': Players previously disqualified for sleeping may rejoin the game. Provided they're well-rested.
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [mutters] Where am I? What time is it? Where are my morning haycakes?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, you were the best teammate I could ask for, but I let wanting to win keep me from seeing that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little. And even if I couldn't...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...we still could've had fun. I'm so sorry for not realizing it. I got so obsessed with one thing, I forgot what really mattered.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sarcastically] No! That doesn't sound like you at all!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, win or lose, nothing is more important than my friend. Or my team. Twi-Pie forever?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I-I don't know.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I understand. I guess even the Princess of Friendship can mess things up with her friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, it's not that. It's  just that I already changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to Sun-Doodle? [chomps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, I have a better idea.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': According to rule thirteen point two, players can join the game at any time, provided they start from zero.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow. These rules are really convoluted. But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, our chances aren't good, but the odds of having fun on Team Twi-Pie are one hundred percent!
:'''Granny Smith''': What is the name of the Ponyville Day Spa's most popular candle?
:[bell rings]
{|
|
:'''Pinkie Pie''':
:Candlelicious Melty Wax!
|
:'''Twilight Sparkle''':
:Competitive Library Musk!

:'''Granny Smith''': Uh... no.
:'''Twilight Sparkle '''and '''Pinkie Pie''': [laugh]
