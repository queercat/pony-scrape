:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:[thud!]
:'''Spike''': Twilight, mail's here!
:[doors opening]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[squeak]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you all right?
:'''Derpy''': We just had a really heavy delivery today.
:'''Spike''': Is it a deluxe set of special edition ''Ogres & Oubliettes'' figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?
:'''Derpy''': Well, it's for Twilight.
:'''Spike''': Awww...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you.
:'''Derpy''': You're welcome!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh. It's from Princess Celestia.
:'''Spike''': [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this? It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a filly!
:'''Spike''': [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! ''And'' here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true!
:'''Spike''': Is my ''Smash Fortune'' comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [muffled] Or this.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! Oh, no! ''Oh, no!''
:'''Spike''': What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record!
:'''Spike''': [clears throat] ''Had'' a perfect record.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] I've never turned in a book even a ''minute'' late! And ''this'' one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville!

:[stamping]
:'''Dusty Pages''': Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I promise I won't let you down!
:'''Dusty Pages''': Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle. After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oooh! I hope I do forever!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of ''Predictions and Prophecies''. What's that for?
:'''Spike''': Well, it ''was'' a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville, and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself!
:'''Spike''': I take it we're going to Canterlot?
:[zip!]
:'''Spike''': [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Spike''': Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes. But what if somepony sees me in there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof.
:'''Spike''': [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A late book is a big deal, Spike. What if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering the building again?!
:'''Spike''': Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell!
:'''Spike''': You sniff books?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''don't?'' I used to ''live'' in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess ''am'' I?
:'''Spike''': One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously]
:'''Spike''': [groans]

:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return.
:'''Librarian Pony''': Princess Twilight! So good to see you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Librarian Pony''': Need some recommendations from the new release section?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's ''Seven Theories on Bending Time''? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter.
:'''Librarian Pony''': Dusty who?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever.
:'''Librarian Pony''': I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous giggle]
:'''Spike''': [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs] Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out this long will probably cost a thousand bits!
:'''Spike''': She— I mean, ''we'' have an overdue book.
:'''Librarian Pony''': [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time.
:'''Spike''': See?
:'''Librarian Pony''': I'll just find it in the card catalog. Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for Ponies Who Should Know Better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't pull any punches with those names, do you?
:'''Spike''': And that office would be...?
:'''Librarian Pony''': In the basement. [whispering] Because of the ''shame''.
:[thud]

:'''Spike''': Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds!
:'''Spike''': ''And'' faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"?
:'''Spike''': [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! I can't wait another minute to return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch!
:'''Spike''': Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips]
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies.
:'''Spike''': Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits!
:'''Spike''': [mock-sobbing]
:'''Pretzel''': Waiter, we're ready to order.
:'''Spike''': Oh, uh, I'm not actually—
:'''Pretzel''': Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us?
:'''Spike''': Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table?
:'''Pretzel''': Sounds great.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Twilight? Is that you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you.
:'''First Folio''': Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-mm.
:'''First Folio''': Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. Forced to leave?
:'''First Folio''': Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Are you okay, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me?
:[whoosh]
:[spinning]
:'''Spike''': That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because ''I'' didn't return this book! Spike, I think ''I'' got her fired!

:[brake skids]
:'''Spike''': Twilight, the library is ''that'' way!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time.
:'''Spike''': But what about your late fees?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're not as important as making things right.
:'''Spike''': Wait. So you're ''not'' going to return the book?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back. It'll fix everything! [sighs]
:[knocking]
:[door opens]
:'''Meathead Pony''': Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm not selling anything.
:'''Meathead Pony''': No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature...
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house.
:'''Meathead Pony''': Dusty Pages?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes!
:'''Meathead Pony''': Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this.
:[thud]
:'''Meathead Pony''': It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to ''change her address!''
:[door slams]

:[montage music]
:[knocking]

:[squeaking]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years." This has to be it!
:'''Spike''': I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight!
:'''Sand Trap''': [snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me!
:'''"Teddie Safari"''': Yes, how may I help you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages?
:'''"Teddie Safari"''': Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe that ''my'' carelessness sent her ''here'', when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books!
:'''Spike''': You realize that might just be a you thing, right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales]
:[knocking]
:[long pause]
:[watch ticking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. We are fixing this ''now''. This place isn't that big. We can find her.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry to interrupt your ''plein air'' painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her?
:'''Apple Rose''': Sure have!
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] And...?
:'''Apple Rose''': She had to leave early to get to her ''fengbi de ti'' session.
:'''Old Stallion''': Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing.
:'''Apple Rose''': Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again.
:'''Old Stallion''': Then there's her band practice later.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you!
:'''Spike''': Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long!

:[montage music]
:[gate swinging]

:[teleportation zap]
:[hammer tapping]
:[door shuts and opens]

:[splash]
:[more splashes]

:[door opens]

:[door opens]
:[band playing music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike!
:'''Spike''': Wait. She looks pretty happy up there.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library!
:[music abruptly stops]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Care to take five, everypony?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've been looking all over Equestria for you!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I need to tell you something.
:'''Dusty Pages''': Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right.
:'''Dusty Pages''': I don't remember you doing anything wrong.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back!
:'''Dusty Pages''': [gasps] It was ''you'' that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back!
:'''Dusty Pages''': No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.

:[band playing music]
:'''Spike''': [snapping fingers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you mind?
:[music pauses, continues softly]
:'''Spike''': [slurping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't understand. If Dusty Pages won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain imperfect!
:'''Spike''': And yours will, too?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more!
:'''Spike''': [dryly] Really?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?!
:[abacus clicking]
:'''Spike''': Uhhh... you don't wanna know.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] It would've been worth all the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I knew why she won't go back!
:'''Spike''': Why don't you ask her?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She didn't seem to want to talk.
:'''Spike''': You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got to lose?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now that I've messed up this much? Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she went? Crochet? Bingo?

:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?!
:[splats]
:'''Spike''': Hey, everypony! We come in—
:[splat]
:'''Spike''': Eh, pieces.
:[splats]
:[teleportation zap]
:[splats]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please?
:'''Dusty Pages''': ''Time out!'' [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear.
:'''Spike''': We're not actually here for the game.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book.
:'''Dusty Pages''': [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if that's what it takes.
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Dusty Pages''': [laughs]
:'''Spike''': That is not the reaction we expected.
:'''Dusty Pages''': Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're not?
:'''Dusty Pages''': No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me.
:[tapping]
:'''Dusty Pages''': All those years I spent hiding away in that library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt something exhilarating!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What was it?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Freedom.
:'''Spike''': From books?
:'''Dusty Pages''': From perfection! I was too stubborn to know when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I wasn't living the life I wanted!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you ''wanted'' to?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Twilight, your late book was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it right!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [strangled scream]
:'''Dusty Pages''': Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But it'll have a stain!
:'''Dusty Pages''': That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't.
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Perfection".
:'''Dusty Pages''': And the next part?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit".
:'''Spike''' and '''Dusty Pages''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier.

:'''First Folio''': Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan?
:'''First Folio''': Twenty-eight bits.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': [gasps]
:'''Spike''': That's ''it''?!
:'''First Folio''': Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts]
:[bits clinking]
:'''First Folio''': Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, is that ''really'' necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all.
:'''Spike''': [clears throat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you?
:'''First Folio''': No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy.
:'''Spike''': In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around.
:'''First Folio''': You sure? It's got a stain.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's what makes it perfect.
