:[light thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table ''without'' using magic, so that— Yikes!
:[silverware clattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Did you...?! How? When? ''What?!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, I heard "set the table" and just kinda went for it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, if you ''hadn't'' used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Should I... change it back?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there ''four'' seats?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. ''And'' how good a teacher you have.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Kidding! [laughs nervously]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs. Cake!
:[small splats]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': How are you, dearie?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Are you baking? Can I help?
:[magic whirls]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow, Mrs. Cake! Look what your new friend made you!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of– [gasps] ''Howza-wowza!'' A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?!
:[splat]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': [yelps and spits]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sorry...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [licks, swallows] In her defense, it ''is'' delicious! [chomps]

:[thump]
:[apples falling]
:'''Applejack''': I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!
:'''Applejack''': He's not much of a talker.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnope.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation.
:[magic wisps]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [motormouth] Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa! What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! ''Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea!'' [screams] ''Make it stop!''
:'''Applejack''': [growls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.
:'''Applejack''': [growls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?
:'''Applejack''': [growls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Alright, I'll change him back!

:'''Rarity''': The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm glad you all got past ''my'' first impression.
:'''Rarity''': Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, with the right outfit, you can do ''anything'', darling!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': When will it be ready?
:'''Rarity''': Three weeks.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dinner's tomorrow.
:'''Rarity''': Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?
:[fabric ripping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ugh! Maybe not.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your ''outfit''. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is ''coolness''.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Like you?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Who's that?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you!
:[sonic boom]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You coming or what?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess my first question would be, "What's a Wonderbolt?"
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] You've ''never'' heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you ''been''?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Right.

:'''Angel''': [giggling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind.
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs]

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with ''me''! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase.
:[more ponies chattering]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [to herself] Stop stressing... ''Stop stressing!''
:[long beat]
:[door opens and shuts]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] This is ''just'' what I needed.
:'''Trixie''': [sighs] Tell me about it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You ever have one of ''those'' days?
:'''Trixie''': For me, they're ''all'' one of those days.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [giggles]
:'''Trixie''': I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?
:'''Trixie''': Ponies judge me on my past too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Finally, a pony I can relate to.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon, strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement! [giggles]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's fantastic news!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She's great!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She's powerful!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Powerful?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She's—
:'''Trixie''': Hello... princess!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trixie?!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You know each other?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You could say that.
:'''Trixie''': We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it.
:[pause]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?
:'''Trixie''': The ''Grrrreat'' and ''Powerful Trrrrixie'' has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it "The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour"!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.
:'''Trixie''': [hushed] It's a working title.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with ''anypony'', but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted ''you''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I hope not. [sighs]

:'''Trixie''': This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen!
:'''Cherry Berry''' and '''Goldengrape''': [unintelligible whispering] ...did you see...?
:'''Caramel''', '''Shoeshine''', and '''Sunshower Raindrops''': [unintelligible whispering] ...did you hear...?
:'''Trixie''': Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's what I'm worried about.
:'''Trixie''': [sighs]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What is it?
:'''Trixie''': I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!
:'''Trixie''': Can you keep a secret?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are friends for?
:'''Trixie''': [hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at ''everything'', and I wanted to beat her at ''something''!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [hushed] Your secret's safe with me.
:'''Trixie''': Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?

:'''Trixie''': I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a ''tad'' messy.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pssssssst! Pssst! ''Psssssst''! Shhhhhh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof.
:'''Trixie''': Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here.
:[bush rustling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [deadpan] Nice to meet you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, no! You can come out now!
:[dubstep playing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So back at your castle when you said "I trust you", you meant "I ''don't'' trust you".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?
:[dubstep fades out]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?
:[thump]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [snorts]
:[bird flapping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! Now he'd be perfect!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]

:[thump]
:[dragging]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic.
:'''Trixie''': Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I meant ''stage'' magic.
:'''Trixie''': Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the ''best''. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do – the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive!
:[silent film-type piano music and film reel flickering]
:'''Trixie''': [narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it off – my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage!
:[film reel runs out]
:'''Trixie''': Completely unharmed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That sounds very...
:'''Trixie''': Dangerous?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I was gonna say cool!
:'''Trixie''': I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not if you could use real magic.
:'''Trixie''': Obviously. Way to rub it in.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you...
:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ...and make you appear in the black box!
:'''Trixie''': I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!
:'''Trixie''': We call it "assistant" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, I'd be honored.
:'''Trixie''': You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.
:'''Trixie''': Oh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Can I vent for a minute?
:'''Trixie''': What are friends for?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Even after Twilight ''says'' she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances.
:'''Trixie''': Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for ''Princess Twilight'', I have ''my'' magic show tonight. If you ''have'' to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant!

:[ice sculpture dripping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh, any minute, heh. Any minute now... [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made three new friends! She has such great taste in friends. I don't know where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said "nosehair trimmers"! What's going on? I'm hungry! And my nose is too hairy. [snorts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle! You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen. Maybe she got lost amongst the, uh... artichokes! [nervous laugh]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! ''Trixie.''

:'''Pinkie Pie''': So ''this'' is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?
:'''Applejack''': Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.
:'''Trixie''': It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. ''Our'' lives.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yes, but—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.
:'''Trixie''': A-''ha!'' You still don't trust me! But guess what, ''princess''? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ''ha!'' I win!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.
:'''Trixie''': Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you? [controlled sobbing]
:'''Trixie''': Wait, it's not like that! I ''am'' your friend. [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, you won. I hope you're happy!
:'''Trixie''': [sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trixie?
:'''Trixie''': ...Which is ''exactly'' the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces!

:[spotlight clanks]
:'''Trixie''': [unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's "Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour".
:[crowd confused]
:'''Trixie''': ''It's a working title!'' [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore.
:[manticore roars]
:'''Fluttershy''': [trembling]
:'''Trixie''': [unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive.
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Trixie''': [unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box. [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But... what if Trixie really ''was'' using me just to one-up you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': From what I've seen, she's the real thing.
:[fuse lights]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.
:[manticore roars]
:[fuse hisses]
:'''Trixie''': Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly echoing] Please?
:[cannon fires]
:[manticore roars]
:'''Trixie''': [shrieks]
:[manticore swallows and belches]
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': [faints]
:[crowd confused]
:[magic zap]
:[crunch]
:'''Trixie''': [woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...!
:[thud]
:[beat]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Trixie''': [amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified] Starlight Glimmer!
:[crowd cheers]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trixie!
:'''Trixie''': What do you want?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.
:'''Trixie''': Thank you, princess.
:[fireworks launch]

:[ice sculpture dripping]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': How do you get your hair to do that all the time?
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs]
