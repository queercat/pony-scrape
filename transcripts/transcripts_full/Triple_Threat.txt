:[cheerful music]
:'''Spike''': Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean "completely out of view". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming?
:[flame bursts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason.
:'''Spike''': I have ''lots'' of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles nervously]
:'''Spike''': Reason number one – I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two – the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three – she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights.
:'''Spike''': Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants ''my'' advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!
:'''Spike''': I... I just want things to be perfect.
:[tap, tap]
:'''Spike''': [gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!
:'''Thorax''': Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''':
:[nervously] Hey!
|
:'''Starlight Glimmer''':
:[nervously] Hello!
|}
:'''Thorax''': Oooh! I can't believe you did all this for me! Great banner! Love the stage! What's this flame thingy? Oh, it's pretty!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!
:'''Spike''': Apparently.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both?
:'''Spike''': I have no idea. [whimpers]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': I completely forgot! Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over. I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember! What am I gonna do?! [teeth chattering]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, maybe they'll like each other.
:'''Spike''': Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...
:'''Thorax''': Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever! Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?
:[warbles]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other.
:'''Spike''': Or worse – they'll ''hate'' each other! And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight... [gulps] I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin Equestria as we know it! [gasps]

:[battle music]
:[explosion]

:'''Spike''': [hyperventilates]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together.
:'''Spike''': So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?
:'''Thorax''': Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both.
:'''Spike''': No!
:'''Thorax''': Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-oh! [whimpers]
:'''Spike''': Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour!
:'''Thorax''': Uh, aren't you coming?
:'''Spike''': Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh.
:[whip]
:[whoosh]
:[boom]
:[fanfare plays]
:'''Spike''': Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands ''and'' for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech.
:'''Ember''': Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing.
:'''Spike''': [chuckles]
:'''Ember''': This place has a lot of colors. In the Dragon Lands, everything's just rocks or the color of ash. [sneezes]
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Ember''': That's probably why.
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Ember''': Hey, Twilight!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, I'm ''Star''light. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you.
:'''Ember''': Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of "-lights" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight?
:'''Spike''': She's in her castle. D'oh!
:'''Ember''': We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying "hi" to your friends, right?
:'''Spike''': Uh, well, yeah, but... [nervous stammering]
:'''Ember''': You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache?
:'''Spike''': Dah. I think I feel one coming on.
:'''Ember''': Well, you know what us dragons say. "Push past the pain!" Now, let's go.
:'''Spike''': Or we could stay here.
:'''Ember''': Or I could go without you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs] Ah, I like her.
:'''Spike''': Ohhh.

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Good. They're not here.
:'''Ember''': What was that?
:'''Spike''': Uh, I... I said, "It's all clean in here!" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet.

:'''Ember''': [crunching loudly] So this is something friends do? I could get used to this. [resumes chomping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, that's not food.
:'''Spike''': [aside] Dragons love gems!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Fine, but ''you're'' telling Twilight what happened to her wall.
:'''Ember''': [continues chomping]
:'''Spike''': Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!
:'''Ember''': Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
:'''Spike''': Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
:'''Ember''': [chomps]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake.
:[door opens]
:'''Thorax''': Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly] This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh, what happened to the ice cream?
:'''Spike''': What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Be right back!
:'''Thorax''': But we didn't get to talk yet! [groans]

:'''Spike''': Ember's here!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?
:'''Spike''': I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this.
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Spike''': Dah! What's happening?! [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think it's the map. It's calling... ''you''. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!
:[dramatic sting]

:'''Spike''': The map is calling ''me''?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out!
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not a good time? I get it.
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and—oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good.
:'''Spike''': I know!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.
:'''Spike''': Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean "find the friendship problem".
:'''Spike''': Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.

:'''Spike''': Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.
:'''Lyra Heartstrings''': [grunts] Well, ''I'' think vanilla strawberry cream ''is'' overused!
:'''Sweetie Drops''': Hmph.
:'''Spike''': Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?

:'''Ember''': Mmm. Mmm. I'm stuffed. [belches]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ember, there you are!
:'''Ember''': Okay, right. More pony hugs.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How's your trip to Ponyville so far?
:'''Ember''': Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously] Oh, my.
:'''Ember''': Where'd Spike and Starlight go? I feel like I'm being avoided. [snorts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town?
:'''Ember''': Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:'''Thorax''': [grunting, sighs]
:[door closes]
:'''Thorax''': Oh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?
:'''Thorax''': But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?
:'''Thorax''': Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I ''am'' a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!

:'''Spike''': ...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
:'''Lyra Heartstrings''': Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike!
:'''Spike''': Oh, come on! Glow!
:'''Thorax''': Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
:'''Spike''': Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, ''really'' great idea.
:'''Thorax''': Well, maybe now we can talk.
:'''Spike''': Uh, sssssure.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'll leave you guys to it.
:'''Thorax''': First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice.
:'''Spike''': Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.
:'''Thorax''': Here's my problem. There's this renegade group of changelings who still feed off of love. Even though I said, "Hey let's not do that anymore," they say, "Hey, this is how we've been doing things for hundreds of years..." [crossfades] ...but it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader and I have to... [fades out]

:[ponies sounding interested]
:'''Ember''': Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons! [roars]
:[ponies scream]
:'''Ember''': Usually when I do that, the dragons are ''eager'' to meet me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not how ''ponies'' make friends.
:'''Ember''': Ah, I get it.
:'''Derpy''': [slurps]
:'''Ember''': This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?
:[splat]
:[honk!]
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, you guys are in town, too?
:'''Ember''': What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No. I'm ''Star''light.
:[beat]
:'''Ember''': Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': What?!

:'''Thorax''': ...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?
:'''Crusoe Palm''': This is ''my'' seat! I saw it first!
:'''"Rainbow Stars"''': Well, ''I'' got here first!
:'''Spike''': Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.
:'''Crusoe Palm''' and '''"Rainbow Stars"''': [growl]
:'''Spike''': Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I think if you made a little effort, you'd find— Whoa! Okay, that had to have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs]
:'''Thorax''': Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think ''I'' should do?
:'''Spike''': [gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, ''really'' come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back.
:'''Thorax''': [sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.

:'''Ember''': I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chuckles] Mine's more of a ''glimmer''. Heh.
:'''Ember''': How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar.
:'''Spike''': Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.
:'''Ember''': But I'm ''right''! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!
:'''Spike''': Uh, well, ''I've'' seen ''you''.
:'''Ember''': ''Are you calling me a liar?!''
:'''Spike''': [chatters]
:'''Thorax''': Hey! No one yells at my friend!
:[transformation noise]
:'''Thorax''': [bear growl]
:'''Ember''': Spike, get away from the bear!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle.
:'''Thorax''': Not anymore! [bear roar]
:'''Ember''': [roars]
:'''Thorax''': [bear growl]
:'''Spike''': [screams] My worst fears are happening!

:'''Spike''': ''Noooo!''
:'''Thorax''': [pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!
:'''Ember''': ''You'' back away! I'm not gonna let ''you'' harm ''him''! Wait. Did you say you're ''not'' gonna let me harm Spike?
:'''Thorax''': Yeah!
:'''Ember''': But that's what ''I'm'' doing!
:'''Thorax''': Uh, what?
:'''Ember''': Yeah, what?
:'''Spike''': [panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie—! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?
:'''Ember''': Why would we be fighting?
:'''Spike''': Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
:'''Ember''' and '''Thorax''': So what?
:'''Spike''': So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
:'''Ember''': Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?
:'''Spike''': No, no, of course not! But— Wait. Isn't that why you're here?
:'''Ember''': ''I'' can say I'm bad at friendship. ''You'' can't say it about ''me''! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.
:'''Spike''': Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry.
:'''Thorax''': No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings!
:'''Spike''': No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?

:[splash]
:[kick]
:[splash]
:'''Ember''': Why are ''you'' still here?
:'''Thorax''': [sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home.
:'''Ember''': Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive.
:'''Thorax''': Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then—
:'''Ember''': Shhh! Stop talking.
:[beat]
:'''Ember''': That's how you do it.
:'''Thorax''': Whoa! That just gave me chills.
:'''Ember''': I know you have it in you. You turned into a ''bear'' to defend Spike.
:'''Thorax''': Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself.
:'''Ember''': There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear.
:'''Thorax''': Oh, well, that's good advice.
:'''Ember''': I know it is.
:'''Thorax''': So what's ''your'' deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
:'''Ember''': I don't want to talk about it.
:'''Thorax''': Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?
:'''Ember''': Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course. [grunts, roars]
:[explosion]
:'''Thorax''': Uh, how does that help?
:[crunch]
:'''Ember''': Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel ''great''.
:'''Thorax''': Right, but, uh, how do you think ''they'' feel?
:'''Ember''': Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.
:'''Thorax''': That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does.
:'''Ember''': [sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.
:'''Thorax''': You know you don't have to be sappy...
:'''Ember''': [blows]
:'''Thorax''': ...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.
:'''Ember''': Uh, I know where we can start.
:[whoosh]
:'''Thorax''': Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.

:'''Spike''': I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.
:[thuds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Or they want to see you now.
:'''Spike''': [gulps]
:'''Ember''': Guess what, Spike.
:'''Spike''': I know. I'm so sorry.
:'''Ember''': ''Let me talk about this!'' I... feel... [strains] ''mad''. [sighs]
:'''Thorax''': Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?
:'''Ember''': [cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] ''upset!''
:'''Spike''': You have every right to be.
:'''Ember''': ''I know I do!'' And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!
:'''Thorax''': Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Whoa.
:'''Ember''': Nice.
:'''Ember''' and '''Thorax''': Ha-ha!
:'''Spike''': You guys ''should'' be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?
:'''Ember''': I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good.
:'''Thorax''': Hah. Me, too. [pleased sounds]
:'''Ember''': [groans] Again?
:'''Spike''': [laughing]
:[spikes shimmering]
:'''Spike''': No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, you ''created'' the friendship problem by not trusting your friends.
:'''Spike''': Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good job, Spike.
:'''Ember''': Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Spike''': [giggling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah, pretty much.
:'''Spike''': Yup.

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Spike''': [through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity.
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Ember''': [sneezes]
:[whoosh]
:[crowd gasps]
:[beat]
:'''Ember''': You should have more things made of rocks.
:[beat]
:'''Spike''', '''Ember''', and '''Thorax''': [laughing]
