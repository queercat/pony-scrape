:'''Nurse Redheart''': Oh, Princess Twilight! Everypony in the hospital is so excited for your visit today!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm never too busy to visit sick foals. I can't believe a whole class just came down with the horsey hives!
:'''Nurse Redheart''': On school picture day, too.
:[camera clicks]
:'''Nurse Redheart''': Oh, the poor dears really do need cheering up.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll do our best. We'll bring snacks, I'll read to them, and get them gifts!
:'''Spike''': Food and presents always cheer ''me'' up.
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll see you soon!
:[door closes]
:'''Spike''': Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse, [sighing] and pick up treats.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule, I know we can get it all done.
:'''Spike''': Yeah, knock on wood.
:[knocking]
:[door opens]
:'''Shining Armor''': Surprise!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Oh, my gosh! How's my favorite niece?
:'''Shining Armor''': [as Flurry Heart] "I'm good! I was hoping my favowite aunt could watch me for a few houwrs."
:'''Princess Cadance''': Hope you're not too busy.
:'''Spike''': Actually, we kind of are— [suddenly muffled]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Busy? [scoffs] Would the best aunt ever be too busy to spend time with this adorable little one?
:[pause]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [multiple kisses]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [blows raspberry] Flurry! I've got a surprise for you!
:[thump]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry.
:[door opens]
:[rattling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm excited to show you I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Oh-ho-ho, you're so sweet. You didn't have to do all that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know, but I can't help myself! Best aunt ever! Open this one, Flurry.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [baby noise] [giggles] [growls like a bear] [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly! They're bears! You're one smart cookie. [making sound effects to elegant music]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:[somewhat less elegant music]
:[alternating elegant and less elegant music stings]
:'''Shining Armor''': We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twily!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-huh. Totally.
:'''Shining Armor''': Mashed peas, her favorite.
:'''Princess Cadance''': And diapers. Uh, extra diapers. Oh, and backup extra diapers. Heh.
:'''Shining Armor''': Mashed peas, her favorite. Wait, did I say that already?
:[thump]
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh.
:'''Shining Armor''': Oops.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Oh, and this is the most important thing of all – her Whammy.
:'''Spike''': I take it Flurry named it?
:'''Princess Cadance''': Yup. If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down.
:'''Shining Armor''': You getting all this, Twily?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whammy. Got it. Where are you guys headed, anyway?
:'''Shining Armor''': You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar.
:'''Shining Armor''': Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute.
:'''Princess Cadance''': We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out.
:'''Spike''': You mean "day"?
:'''Princess Cadance''': That's what I said! Isn't that what I said?
:'''Spike''': Mmm... Mm-mm.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Either way, are you sure you can watch her?
:'''Spike''': Uh-uh-uh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mmmmh...
:'''Flurry Heart''': [squeaks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Have no fear! The best aunt ever has everything under control!
:'''Princess Cadance''' and '''Shining Armor''': [kissing]
:'''Shining Armor''': Thanks again, Twily.
:'''Spike''': Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go.
:[magic zap]
:'''Flurry Heart''': Uh-uh! [growls like a bear]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, you want to pretend ''we're'' the bears. I suppose we have time for a quick game.
:'''Spike''': Do we, though?
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey! All right! [growls like a bear] I'm gonna get ya!
:[toy squeaking]
:'''Spike''': Ugh! [sighs] You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do! Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Got it! [growls like a bear] I'm catching up!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [happy squeals]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [growls like a bear]
:'''Flurry Heart''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [roars like a bear]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [squeaks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-oh. Sorry, bug. Did that scare you? It's okay. It's just Auntie Twily!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [blows raspberry] Bleh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age. Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily.
:'''Spike''': All right, that ''was'' pretty adorable. But now...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know, Spike, we're leaving.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [stomach grumbles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I just have to feed her real quick.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [blows raspberry]
:[splat]

:'''Shining Armor''': Is this art or... a mistake?
:'''Princess Cadance''': I have no idea. But who cares? We're not changing diapers.
:'''Spearhead''': Shining Armor! Cadance! How are the new 'rents? Gimme some hoof. Oh, it is so [grunt] good [grunt] to see you dudes! Hey, thanks for coming.
:'''Shining Armor''': Of course! We're having a great time! Loving all the... art!
:'''Spearhead''': Uh, that's a trash can.
:'''Shining Armor''': So it is! I knew that!
:'''Spearhead''': But hey, who's to say it's ''not'' art? Art can be anything that speaks to you. It changed my world. This is my latest piece – "A Thousand Nights in a Hallway".
:'''Princess Cadance''': Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark.
:'''Spearhead''': [seriously] There is none more dark.
:'''Shining Armor''': [baffled] Yeah. Totally.
:'''Princess Cadance''': We're just so happy to be here. Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.

:'''Spike''': When they said mashed peas were her favorite...
:[splat]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:'''Spike''': ...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aw, come on, Spike. That wasn't too bad.
:'''Spike''': Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Twenty minutes?! [exhales] It's fine. We can totally do this.
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [embarrassed giggle]

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here.
:[shopping cart squeaking]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [roars like a bear]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You want to play, don't you? Well, I know a game that's even ''more'' fun! [aside to Spike] And more efficient. [to Flurry Heart] Playing race carts! Ha-ha!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Woo-hoo!
:[tires squealing]
:'''Spike''': [panting] [out of breath] Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Best aunt ever! Hang on, Flurry. The race cart's taking a pit stop.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:[cart rattling]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?! [sighs] Well, we'd better get to cleaning. We've got no time to waste!
:'''Salespony''': Thanks, but they were organized by color.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [snorts, sighs]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting]
:[tires squealing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting] Yes! We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!
:'''Spike''': Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were ''already'' behind... we're still... fifty five minutes behind!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': I mean... [nervous chuckle] Yay, team?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-hmm!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee. Sorry we were late.
:'''Cheerilee''': Oh, no problem. But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book. Don't you have a huge collection?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but—
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:[stroller springs squeaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, one second.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [annoyed grunt] [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't think the foals would be interested in ''The Unabridged History of Amulets'' in pony Latin.
:'''Cheerilee''': Yeah, it was good you came to me. How about the complete collection of ''Ponyville Fables and Stables''?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mmm, too long.
:'''Cheerilee''': ''Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates''?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, the science there is preposterous—
:'''Spike''': How about ''Burnferno, Warrior from Within''? It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath ''and'' his snappy comebacks!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles] Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.
:'''Spike''': Eh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What else?
:[Whammy squeaks]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:[magic zap]
:'''Cheerilee''': Uh, how about ''Gusty the Great''?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly! We'll take it!
:'''Cheerilee''': [teeth chattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm, should I go with something more current...? [gasps]
:'''Flurry Heart''': Ta-da!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry! I didn't even hear her leave!
:[erasing noises]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [worried noise]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There, all clean.
:'''Cheerilee''': Great. Now I'll just write it up again...! [slightly muffled] With my mouth.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ehh...

:'''Spearhead''': Feast your eyes. This one's called "A Kitchen Guard's Journey"!
:'''Princess Cadance''': [unsure] Oh...
:'''Shining Armor''': This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet.
:'''Princess Cadance''': That took forever to clean up! But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?
:'''Shining Armor''': Yeah. She was like, [imitating Flurry Heart] "Uh-oh!"
:'''Princess Cadance''' and '''Shining Armor''': [laughing]
:'''Spearhead''': Whoa, art is so evocative! I wasn't even going for that memory! Score!

:[stroller squeaking]
:'''Spike''': Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are. Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! Cancel?! We can't cancel, Spike! The sick foals are counting on us! And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!
:'''Spike''': B.A.E.?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Best Aunt Ever"? Besides, this errand is gonna be different.
:'''Spike''': How do you figure that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins ''and'' stay out of trouble! Best aunt ever!

:'''Pound Cake''': [giggling] [suddenly shuts up]
:'''Cake Twins''' and '''Flurry Heart''': [baby noises]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wonderful! They're friends already!
:[toy squeaks]
:'''Spike''': Huh. I shouldn't have doubted you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks! Wait, you doubted me?
:'''Spike''': [nervous squeak]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, you watch Flurry. I'll take care of everything else. [quickly, to Pinkie Pie] Hi, Pinkie! How's it going? I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital! And can you do apology treats?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm good. Here they are. Of course I can!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': In my secret party planning cave!
:[ding!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': BRB!
:[papers rustling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hee-hee! Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are. Cheerilee?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eh. I am pretty awesome.
:[paper rustling]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great! Can you write "sorry" on them?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I've got a stamp for that!
:[stamp]
:'''Cake Twins''': [arguing baby noises]
:'''Spike''': Hey, you guys! No need to fight! Uh... Hang on! I'm sure there's another one! Ugh, no, not this one... Oh, that's cute...
:[toys thudding and squeaking]
:'''Cake Twins''': [screaming]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hold on, sweetie. We'll play in a second.
:[snap]
:[magic noises]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The salespony at the toy store...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
:'''Cake Twins''': [grunts]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [yelps]
:[splat]
:'''Cake Twins''': [grunts]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [noise of alarm]
:[paper ripping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. You're making the same face Cheerilee made. Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmm... The sampler platter.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll take three of those.
:'''Spike''': Aha! Told you I'd find another one. [gasps]
:[balloon pops]
:'''Spike''': [chuckles nervously]
:[splat]

:'''Spike''': Uh... Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Out of the question! We are ''not'' cancelling! It's going to be okay! It has to be okay! It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up— Oh...
:[squirt]
:'''Spike''': Uh, sorry.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] No, I needed it.
:'''Spike''': I was just gonna say, we're here.
:[tires screeching]
:'''Spike''': And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Four and a half?!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "...and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred! She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill. But suddenly, they encountered..."
:'''Spike''': [gasps] What?! What was it?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "It was the treacherous Grogar..."
:'''Flurry Heart''': [baby noises underneath]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "...and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle. Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors—" Ow! Not right now, Flurry. These foals really want to hear this.
:[kettle whistling]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [throws tantrum]
:[Whammy squeaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "'We can fight Grogar together!' And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one! The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down!"
:[magic zaps under]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground! 'Don't let him escape!', yelled Gusty!"
:'''Flurry Heart''': [worried squeaks]

:[magic zaps]

:'''Nurse Redheart''': Say 'ah'.
:'''Cherry Fizzy''': Ahhh—
:[magic zap]
:'''Cherry Fizzy''': —aaargh!
:[magic zap]

:[magic zaps and thuds]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Grogar was strong, for fear gave him power, and he broke through the bonds!"
:'''Flurry Heart''': [worried noises]
:'''Foals''': [worried yelps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know! So good, right?
:'''Spike''': Twilight, look up!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, you're floating. You're floating!
:'''Spike''': So are you!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [worried noises]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Flurry, honey, you need to stop this. Put us down, please.
:'''Spike''': Twilight, look out!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': [screaming]
:[thud, thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nopony panic! Everything's gonna be okay!
:[magic zap]
:[thud]
:[magic zap]
:[thud]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I can't keep up with her!
:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah, where's her Snoozle?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Her what?!
:'''Spike''': You know, her Whacky Whompy thing? The snail? Where is it? Cadance said it calms her down.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't see it!
:'''Foals''': [worried noises]
:[magic noises]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Flurry Heart! Put us all down this instant!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [worried noise]
:'''Foals''' and '''Nurse Redheart''': [yelps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is everypony okay?
:'''Foals''': [noises of assent]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Flurry, that was very, very bad! You could have hurt somepony!
:'''Flurry Heart''': [starts crying]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to—
:'''Flurry Heart''': [continues crying]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. It's just me, see?
:'''Flurry Heart''': [confused crying noise]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're scared of ''me''. Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear. Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've been a terrible aunt today. All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you. None of this is your fault. It's mine. So much for being the best aunt ever. But I hope you know how much I love you.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I take it you forgive me?
:'''Flurry Heart''': [honk]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks, Flurry. How about we head home? After we find your Whammy, of course.
:'''Nurse Redheart''': [clears throat, taps hoof]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And clean up. [embarrassed giggle]

:'''Princess Cadance''': [tearing up] This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.
:'''Shining Armor''': [tearing up] Uh-huh. And this one reminds me of Flurry too.
:'''Spearhead''': How so?
:'''Shining Armor''': It's small... like her! I-I can't do this anymore! Spearhead, this has been great, but—
:'''Spearhead''': Say no more. My art has always spoken to me about what I love. But knowing that it spoke to you about what ''you'' love speaks to me.
:'''Shining Armor''': What...?
:'''Spearhead''': Go to her.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:[magic zap]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [muffled giggling] [unmuffled giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Flurry Heart''': [giggling]
:[door opens]
:'''Shining Armor''': Flurry?! Where's our little foal?! Ah! Oh, we missed you so much!
:'''Princess Cadance''' and '''Shining Armor''': [loving chuckles]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [encouraging noises]
:'''Princess Cadance''' and '''Shining Armor''': [sighs]
:'''Princess Cadance''': But it looks like you had a great time without us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, not so much. Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault. I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule. It was too much to juggle. But Flurry taught me an important lesson today. It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the ''most'' time with your niece, but spending ''quality'' time with her. And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things.
:'''Princess Cadance''' and '''Shining Armor''': [laughing]
:'''Shining Armor''': Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Yes! From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohh, that would be great.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [surprised snort]
:'''Princess Cadance''': For dinner, not to babysit.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckle] I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free.
:'''Princess Cadance''': Where is Spike, anyway?

:'''Spike''': [reading] "The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset. 'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!'"
:'''"Peach Fuzz"''': Hey, you kinda look like him!
:'''Spike''': Thank you! Okay, now who wants more cake?
:'''Foals''': [cheering]
