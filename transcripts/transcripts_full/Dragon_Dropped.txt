:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [singsong] Oh, Spiiiike? Are you in here? Hellooooo?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm...
:'''Rarity''': Oh, there you are! I was starting to think you weren't here. I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick trip to the gem cave! I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike.
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spiiiike?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': [echoing] ''SPIKE!''
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': What? Oh. Hey, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, Spike. It's almost as if you haven't been listening.
:'''Spike''': [blows fire] Oh, uh... of course I was. But just to be sure, could you say it all again?
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave—
:'''Spike''': Oh, no! Is that the time?!
:'''Rarity''': Aah!
:'''Spike''': [panting]
:'''Rarity''': Of course, you're right. This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh.
:[doors open]
:'''Rarity''': But the real question is which basket do you want to hold? The smaller one, right? [laughs]
:'''Spike''': Oh, right. Sorry, Rarity. Can I take a rain check on... What was that again?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': The... gem cave?
:'''Spike''': Right. Sounds great. But I need to get to the post office before noon.
:'''Rarity''': [laughs] All right, very funny. Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall— 
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike? Hello?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': I don't understand. For as long as we've known each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here. It's his favorite place.
:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Ideally you catch the gems, dear. And for a trip to the post office of all places?
:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Maybe you should move closer? And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all? He sends mail by breathing! Breathing, darling! Breath mail!
:[gems clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.
:'''Applejack''': [spits] And how's that?
:'''Rarity''': Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats.
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': ''And'' he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] Rarity, Spike's been followin' you closely since he got to Ponyville. And in case you hadn't noticed... [echoing] ''I AIN'T SPIKE!''
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Applejack''': [yelping]
:'''Rarity''': Actually, Applejack, I had noticed!

:[doors open]
:[books thudding]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, hi, Rarity. What's up?
:'''Rarity''': Ugh! Besides my mane? Well, that is a question for Spike.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I think he's at the post office.
:[scraping sounds]
:'''Rarity''': Again?! What is it with Spike and the post office?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, what's going on?
:'''Rarity''': Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm. That doesn't sound like Spike. Did you two have some sort of fight?
:'''Rarity''': A fight? Goodness, Twilight. What in Equestria would we fight about?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've had arguments with friends before, and they can put a real strain on friendships.
:'''Rarity''': Well, certainly. But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you didn't realize it? Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?
:'''Rarity''': Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it? [brays] I wonder if that's it. It certainly would explain his behavior. I must apologize!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For what?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pfft. That's hardly the point. Poor Spikey-Wikey! This calls for a grand gesture!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Good talk. [groans]

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [grunting]
:[scraping]
:[clang!]
:'''Gabby''': Wow! That's a big crate of stuff you're mailing.
:'''Rarity''': I'm not mailing it.
:'''Gabby''': Then why are you pushing it into the post office?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office.
:'''Gabby''': Oh! [giggles] No, I don't work here exactly. I'm the official mail carrier of Griffonstone. Gabby Griffon. Nice to meet ya!
:[rattling]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending. They're for apologizing to Spike.
:'''Gabby''': Oh! Spike was just here. He went to go make us a—
:'''Rarity''': That's perfect! It'll give me a chance to practice. Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.
:'''Gabby''': What are you apologizing for?
:'''Rarity''': Darling, I don't see why that matters.
:[clattering]
:[gems clinking]
:[thud]
:[ka-chunk!]
:[deep boom]
:[music playing]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter! Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Gabby''': [muffled speech]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, sorry, dear. Here.
:'''Gabby''': I said, that sure sounds genuine.
:'''Rarity''': Well, of course it sounds genuine! It ''is'' genuine!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing?
:'''Rarity''': Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike. I don't know how I could be more genuine. I mean— [gasps] Spike!
:[zip!]
:[ka-chunk!]
:[deep boom]
:[music playing]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] Oh, Spike! I am so sorry! Please forgive me!
:[crash!]
:[cat yowls]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] You have to forgive me! I don't know what I did or why you're mad at me! Just please say you forgive me! [wailing] Pleeeeeeeease!
:'''Spike''': Of course I forgive you. But, uh, what are you apologizing for?
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Rarity''': Why does everypony keep harping on that—?! Wait. Don't ''you'' know?
:'''Spike''': No, I'm not mad at you about anything.
:'''Rarity''': B-But... But I don't understand. If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?
:'''Spike''': Uh, because I had other plans?
:[clattering]
:'''Gabby''': With me!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]

:'''Rarity''': I don't understand. You two know each other?
:'''Spike''': Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.
:'''Gabby''': Yeah! There was this whole thing where I pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark! Which I didn't really have.
:'''Spike''': Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.
:'''Gabby''': Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.
:'''Spike''': [slurps] And we're both in the message-sending business!
:'''Gabby''': Uh-huh!
:'''Spike''' and '''Gabby''': [chomp, gulp]
:'''Gabby''': I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!
:'''Spike''' and '''Gabby''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': [forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat. Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow. Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.
:'''Spike''': Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.
:'''Gabby''': Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing. [sighs] Speaking of which, I better get going.
:'''Spike''': I'll fly with you.
:'''Rarity''': Well, all right. You two fly along. I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other—
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': ...time?

:'''Rarity''': I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal! And there's the pink! How will I ever choose?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting] Too bad Spike's not here. I bet he could help you narrow it down.
:'''Rarity''': He is a good sounding board, isn't he?
:[muffled thud]
:[curtains close]

:[montage music]

:[camera clicks]
:[bits clinking]

:[door opens]

:[door opens]
:[thud]
:[slurping]

:[sewing machine whirring]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear? I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Even closer, darling. I don't want to prick you. I have to admit everything feels a bit "less than" without him. Too close!
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, it's no use. Thank you for trying. I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.

:'''Spike''': [snoring] Aah!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I am sorry, Spike. I didn't mean to frighten you.
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing here?
:'''Rarity''': Well, I realize it's late. Or rather, early. But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it. The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!
:[click]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Rarity''': It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years.
:'''Spike''': Oh. But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.
:'''Rarity''': I see. Well, there's always next year.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': You know what? I'll just write her a note.
:'''Rarity''': Are you sure?
:'''Spike''': Absolutely.

:[train chugging]
:[train hisses]
:[gems clinking]
:'''Spike''': Wow. Rarity, you weren't kidding. The Gem Crevasse was amazing! I'll be snacking on these for a week.
:'''Rarity''': What did I tell you?
:'''Gabby''': Hey, Spike!
:'''Spike''': Gabby! You won't believe where I went today!
:'''Gabby''': Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm!
:[gems clinking]
:'''Gabby''': Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!
:'''Spike''': Absolutely! [grunts] Thanks again, Rarity. What a great day.

:'''Gabby''': Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!
:'''Spike''': Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!
:'''Gabby''': That is amazing! Then what?!
:[thud]
:'''Gabby''': Whoa!
:'''Spike''': Sorry, Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no apology necessary, Spike. In fact, I was just looking for you.
:'''Spike''': You were? Why?
:'''Rarity''': Because I just acquired... these!
:'''Spike''': Passes to Power Ponypalooza!? For today!?
:'''Rarity''': Mm-hmm! I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do.
:'''Spike''': Uh... of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.
:'''Gabby''': Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have ''two'' things to tell me about!
:'''Spike''': Okay! Come on, Rarity! Let's go!

:'''Spike''': Whew! Are my claws sore.
:'''Rarity''': Indeed. I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!
:'''Spike''': [grunting] Aww. I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.
:'''Rarity''': Whoo. I know what you mean. Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Spike''': [grunting]
:'''Spike''': [chuckles] I think maybe you're right.
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well. [laughs]
:[door opens]

:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.
:'''Spike''': No way! ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?!
:'''Rarity''': Well, I know how much you enjoy it. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.

:[door opens]
:'''Gabby''': [echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Spike''': [laughter fading in]
:'''Rarity''': Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?
:'''Spike''': Oh, she can try... Success! Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack! And then—!
:'''Gabby''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Oh, hi, Gabby. We were just—
:'''Gabby''': Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today. But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me.
:'''Spike''': No-no-no-no! That's not true! I can come with you on your rounds right now!
:'''Gabby''': I don't think so, Spike. Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on.
:[thermos clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Oooh! Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!

:'''Rarity''': What do you think, Spike? Solids or prints?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Prints, I guess. You already have a lot of solid colors.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, you are so right. Prints it is! So nice to have you back, Spike.
:[cash register rings]
:'''Rarity''': Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.
:'''Spike''': I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.

:[montage music]

:'''Rarity''': I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Yeah...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. I've never seen Spike this sad before. Do you know what happened?
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat] Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think that's it.
:'''Rarity''': I... suppose... it's possible it could have something to do with... [coughs] Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What? I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time.
:'''Rarity''': They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of ''O&O'', I managed to get some time in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all.
:'''Rarity''': What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours.
:'''Rarity''': I know, but now I have to share him! Which I suppose I'll have to get used to. [gasps] Right after I fix the mess I've made!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good talk.

:'''Gabby''': [sighs]
:[door opens]
:[music playing]
:'''Gabby''': Rarity? Is all this stuff for Spike again? Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him? And why are you even here?
:'''Rarity''': I am here to apologize. Actually, more to confess. And all of this stuff isn't for Spike. It's the evidence against me!
:'''Gabby''': Evidence? For what?
:'''Rarity''': For my acts of utter selfishness!
:'''Gabby''': I don't understand.
:'''Rarity''': These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!
:'''Gabby''': They are? You did?
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing?
:'''Rarity''': Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike. Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive— [gasps] Spike?! Oh. I actually owe you an apology, too.
:'''Gabby''': You apologize a lot.
:'''Rarity''': I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.
:'''Spike''': You really miss spending time with me?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, of course!
:'''Gabby''': I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I understand why. You're kinda awesome! And I know what it's like to miss that now, too.
:'''Spike''': So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?
:'''Gabby''': Absolutely.
:'''Spike''': I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?
:'''Gabby''': I sure would!
:'''Rarity''': Wonderful! I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have— [laughs] ...reconciled.

:[pickaxe clinking]
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] I suppose Twilight is right. Friendships do change.
:[gem shattering]
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panicked yelping, whispering] Sorry! I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Darling. Catching the gems is what the basket is for.
:'''Spike''': [whispering] Wow. You two need to be a lot quieter.
:'''Rarity''': Spike! How wonderful to see you!
:'''Spike''': Yeah. Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.
:[pickaxe clinking]
:[gem shattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ohhhh! So that's how it works!
:[wings flapping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rarity''', and '''Spike''': [scream]
