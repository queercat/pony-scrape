:'''Trixie''': I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! Speaking of...
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [sighs, blows, sips]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh. One sec.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [sips]
:[spoon clattering]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What was I saying? Oh, right. Being able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
:'''Trixie''': Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time with you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
:'''Trixie''': Well...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chewing]
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [mouth full] Hold that thought.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [growls, chomps]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you were saying?
:'''Trixie''': [sips]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously]

:'''Silverstream''': I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree Forest! How would ''you'' describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
:'''Silverstream''': I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
:'''Silverstream''': "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
:'''Trixie''': Except for today, of course.
:[door closes]
:'''Student Pony''': [whimpers]
:'''Trixie''': If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any issues before ''they'' head home for the holiday.
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Trixie''': I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': Sunburst is coming to town?
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': You and I promised to make the cake?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': [low growl]
:[door closes]

:'''Trixie''': Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have to do.
:'''Trixie''': Good!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great!
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So... what ''are'' all the things we have to do?
:'''Trixie''': [whines] Maud needs streamers for the decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course he does.
:'''Trixie''': Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were ''both'' looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
:'''Trixie''': We could... but then we'd miss out on baking ''together''. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to ''make'' a cake, not ''buy'' a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie ''keeps her promises!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': —get started on those sticks, and I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang on to this? Wouldn't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Rose''': Could it be plum blossom?
:'''Trixie''': I have no idea.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
:'''Trixie''': I thought ''I'' was getting the flowering sticks.
:'''Rose''': Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
:'''Trixie''': No one is.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': —riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]
:[teleportation zap]
:[glue squirting]

:'''Silverstream''': I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.

:[bracelet chiming]
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was ''my'' job! I think. Wait. Was it?
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:[teleportation zap]

:[transformation zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but—
:'''Silverstream''': Counselor Starlight!
:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word "dry". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.

:[door closes]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wait, Mrs. Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake! 
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single thing.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course it is.
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:[click]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie? What are you doing here?
:'''Trixie''': It's the one place I knew I could find you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I am so sorry about today. I'm just so—
:'''Trixie''': Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's not—!
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': Starlight, you have a minute?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time ''you'' caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, the counselor's office is closed.
:[door closes]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I have a cake to bake.

:[clatter]
:'''Sunburst''': Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
:'''Trixie''': [growls]
:'''Sunburst''': I mean, it looks really... interesting?
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
:'''Trixie''': [growls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
:'''Trixie''': And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office in the middle of it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
:'''Terramar''': Hello?! Starlight?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [spits]
:'''Terramar''': Starlight?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
:'''Terramar''': Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What's wrong?
:'''Terramar''': I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:'''Trixie''': [chewing]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
:'''Terramar''': Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
:'''Sunburst''': It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
:'''Terramar''': Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. They sent me to check the school.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
:'''Terramar''': Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She never told me about a project.
:'''Trixie''': Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Trixie''': [short laugh]
:'''Terramar''': What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
:'''Trixie''': The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean ''always''.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Except apparently when it matters. This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will check the school. We'll find your sister.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.
:'''Mudbriar''': Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.
:[beat]
:'''Mudbriar''': But that's probably not important.

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.

:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Silverstream?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [echoing] Hello?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Anycreature?!

:[splash]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Terramar''': [panting] She's not down here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't see her anywhere.
:'''Terramar''': Did you check her room?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, she's not here.
:'''Terramar''': No, she isn't. But look at this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': A cockatrice?
:'''Terramar''': Could that be what her project was on? You don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by herself, do you?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
:[teleportation zap]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously]
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''All''': [yelps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are you all doing here?
:'''Sunburst''': We came to help.
:'''Trixie''': We couldn't let you handle this alone.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, she wasn't alone.
:[beat]
:'''Mudbriar''': But we wanted to help anyway.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks. All of you. But the students are ''my'' responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
:'''Trixie''': I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But I don't want to ruin your party.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
:'''Terramar''': Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
:'''Trixie''' and '''Sunburst''': [gasp]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
:'''Sunburst''': What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! ''And'' the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
:'''Trixie''': I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!
:[zip!]

:[tense music]
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!

:'''Trixie''': This way!

:'''Trixie''': [sniffs]
:[wind whistling]

:[owl hoots]

:'''Trixie''': [slurp, chews, spits]

:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Weren't we just here?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
:'''Trixie''': No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
:'''Sunburst''': We might need a more concrete plan.
:'''Trixie''': Hmph. Suit yourself.
:'''Terramar''': Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
:'''Trixie''': Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find ''that'' in a forest.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris ''can'' grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You complete me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': There's some pine trees over there!

:[cockatrices clucking and hissing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
:'''Sunburst''': [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
:'''Terramar''': [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
:[cockatrice hisses]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically—
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] Don't even say it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
:'''Terramar''': [whispering] So what do we do?
:[cockatrices hiss]
:'''Sunburst''': ''Ruuuuun!''
:[teleportation zap]

:[cockatrices squawk]
:'''Sunburst''': [screaming]
:[thud]
:'''Sunburst''': [groans, babbles] 
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sunburst!
:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': Aah!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Stop! It's me!
:'''Sunburst''': Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. Hang on.
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Sunburst''': Be careful!

:[clucking and hissing]
:'''Terramar''': The clucking is coming from everywhere!
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!
:[poof!]
:[cockatrices hiss]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Come on!
:[teleportation zap]
:[cockatrices hiss]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Sunburst''': Aah!
:[teleportation zap]

:[cockatrices hiss]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maud! We've got to get out of here!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''', '''Sunburst''', and '''Terramar''': [gasps]
:'''Sunburst''': Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.
:'''Trixie''': We've got to get out of here!
:'''Terramar''': But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!
:[cockatrices hiss]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, we can't stay here! Come on!
:[cockatrices hissing]
:[leaves rustling]
:[cockatrice clucks]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [screams]
:[cockatrices hissing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This way!
:[cockatrices hiss]
:[doors open]
:[doors close]
:[thudding]
:'''Trixie''': Now what?!
:'''Sunburst''': Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
:'''Terramar''': Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] This ''is'' all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
:'''Trixie''': That seems a little extreme.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, ''and'' Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
:'''Trixie''': Has that always been there?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What? Oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of course! That should've been the first place we looked!
:[scraping]
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
:'''Silverstream''': Counselor Starlight, no!
:'''Edith''': [hisses]
:'''Silverstream''': Wait!
:[magic humming]
:'''Edith''': [clucking softly]
:'''Silverstream''': This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I... don't understand.
:'''Silverstream''': After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, so I came here.
:'''Terramar''': Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
:'''Silverstream''': Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
:'''Edith''': [clucking softly]
:'''Sunburst''': I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
:'''Silverstream''': They are really fascinating creatures. Did you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I have a few ideas.
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps]

:'''Silverstream''': I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
:'''Sunburst''': [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, I will always be a stick pony. But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the density and permanence of rock.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Swoon.
:'''Terramar''': Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
:'''Sunburst''': You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm not so sure.
:'''Silverstream''': I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
:'''Trixie''': Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you ''really'' need to talk about?
:'''Silverstream''': To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah— Wait, what?!
:'''Trixie''': Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous—?
:[clang!]
:'''Sunburst''': Petrified dessert?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You had me at "petrified".
:'''All except Maud Pie''': [laughing]
