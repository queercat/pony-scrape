:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It wasn't easy getting Twilight's memories of all her friends in there without her realizing it... but we did it!
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm not so sure you did.
:'''Spike''': What do you mean?
:'''Princess Celestia''': You are both so thoughtful. Clearly Twilight is important to you. But don't you think ''you'' might be important to ''her'' as well?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Right! We forgot to add ourselves!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, I can't believe we forgot to put in some Twilight memories of us!
:'''Spike''': And the coronation is tomorrow. There isn't time to track Twilight down and get her to remember more stuff.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know we wanted the book to be full of Twilight's memories, but we'll just have to use our own.
:'''Spike''': I've got a lot of those. My memories of Twilight go as far back as I can remember.

:'''Crystal Clear''': Well, Miss Sparkle?
:'''Arpeggio''': [cough]
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': [groaning]
:'''Top Marks''': [yawn]
:'''Crystal Clear''': We don't have all day.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] I knew it was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sorry I wasted your time.
:[explosion]

:'''Spike''': She's always been there when I really needed her.

:'''Rarity''': What do you mean ''you'' have to win the Gauntlet?
:'''Spike''': It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!
:'''Spike''': I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Um, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
:'''Spike''': He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.
:'''Spike''': ''I'm'' the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.
:'''Spike''': I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aww! It's me, right?
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm!

:'''Princess Celestia''': Your relationship with Twilight is certainly special, Spike. But I know from experience the relationship between a teacher and pupil is as well.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah... [nervous laugh] Twilight and I didn't start out as warm and fuzzy as she and Spike did.

:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wh– I studied that spell for years! How can you—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!
:'''Double Diamond''': How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!
:[magic zap]

:[magic zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now more than ever I know how important it is to stop you!
:[crunch]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, good luck!
:'''Young Rainbow Dash''': Whoooaaaa!
:[magic zaps]

:[crunching]
:[magic zaps]

:[magic zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [clapping]

:[squeaks]
:[splatting]
:[magic zap]

:[magic zap]
:[sound of machinery]
:[magic zap]

:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. You were right. I can't stop you.
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you can't stop me from trying, and we could be stuck doing this for all eternity!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': If that's what it takes to keep you and your ''friends'' from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game!
:[magic zap]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, but all that's totally behind me now! Obviously. Everything changed when Twilight reached out her hoof in friendship.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I ''do'' know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll ''really'' happen?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ugh! What's ''so special'' about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just ''my'' friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': How do I know they won't all end the same way?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.

:[clink, clink, clink]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If I could have everypony's attention! As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out that's just not meant to be.
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squeals, giggles] What a great surprise!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to Starlight] The future's in your own hooves now.

:'''Spike''': [sighs] I can't believe we almost forgot to include ourselves.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Mm-hmm. What's wrong?
:'''Princess Celestia''': After hearing your memories, I couldn't help but think of some of my own.
:'''Princess Luna''': I, too, have fond remembrances of Twilight. Do you think you might include our recollections as well?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course!

:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:[magic surging]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight Sparkle.
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
:'''Princess Celestia''': You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Princess Celestia''': But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal protégé here at the school.
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well?
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': Yes!
:'''Princess Celestia''': One other thing, Twilight.
:'''Young Twilight Sparkle''': More? My cutie mark! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...

:'''Princess Celestia''': Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Spike, take a note, please. ''I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.''
:[ponies cheer]

:'''Pipsqueak''': Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever.
:[wind whistling]
:'''Nightmare Moon''': [booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating ''you''!
:'''Ponies''': [scream]
:'''Princess Luna''': [spit] I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just wait.
:'''Princess Luna''': For what? For... for them to scream some more?
:'''Pipsqueak''': Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?
:'''Princess Luna''': Child. Art thou saying that thou... ''likest'' me to scare you?
:'''Pipsqueak''': It's really fun! Scary, but fun!
:'''Princess Luna''': It... is?
:'''Pipsqueak''': Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.
:'''Princess Luna''': Well then. We shall have to bring [booming voice] Nightmare Night back!
:'''Pipsqueak''': Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever! [to foals] She said yes, guys!
:'''Foals''': YAY!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': See? They really do like you, princess.
:'''Princess Luna''': Can it be true?

:'''Princess Luna''': I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night... [pants] ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon!
:'''Fluttershy''': But why would you do that?!
:'''Princess Luna''': To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!
:'''Princess Luna''': How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But look at what ''you're ''doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! ''You're'' doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust ''us ''enough to believe we're right?
:[Tantabus growling]
:'''Princess Luna''': ...I do!

:'''Spike''': Is everything okay, Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We set out to make a book filled with Twilight's memories of her friends. But using our memories made me realize we should put everypony's memories in!
:'''Spike''': But the coronation's tomorrow. How are we gonna do that?!

:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay, Celestia and Luna came up with some last-minute "princess etiquette" for Twilight to learn, but we don't have much time.
:'''Rarity''': I thought you were nearly finished with your book of memories.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We were, but then we put in our own memories of Twilight and wanted to give all of you the chance to do the same.
:'''Main ponies''': Hmmm...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh! Like how she's always prepared for everything ever?
:'''Applejack''': Or how much she loves books?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or how she freaks out all the time?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're here!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Isn't this exciting?!
:[cutie mark ringing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! You were called, too! Thank goodness. I feel so much better going with a friend.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was about to come and get you, but then I got distracted.
:[doors open]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ever since the map called us, I've been doing a ton of research.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Testing out potential friendship problems.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Diversifying my solution portfolio.
:'''Fluttershy''': Ever since the map called us? But that happened five minutes ago.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know! But I wanna be one hundred percent prepared! I mean, I'm the Princess of Friendship. How would it look if I couldn't solve a friendship problem?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts, to Twilight] Do we wanna know why you're wrapping up everypony in town?
:'''Spike''': Not ''wrapping'' paper. A to-do list.
:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Two of these! Three of those! I'm gonna need ''ten'' of those! Just in case!
:'''Rarity''': Twilight, darling, are you all right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sure! Just-grabbing-a-few-things-do-I-need-this-no-that's-silly-I-need-''eight!''
:'''Applejack''': Hey, y'all! What's everypony—? Ohhh. Traditional holiday meltdown?
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Fluttershy''', '''Rarity''', '''Spike''', '''Pinkie Pie''': Uh-huh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Applejack''': [calmly and quietly] Hey, Twilight. How's your day?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I got way behind grading midterms, and Cadance and Shining Armor are coming here with Flurry Heart for Hearth's Warming Eve, and I haven't started decorating, and I don't know what to get any of you, and—!
:'''Applejack''': Stop! Take a breath.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [inhales deeply]
:'''Applejack''': Now let it out sloooooooooowwww...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [exhales slowly]
:'''Applejack''': Now, I think I have an idea that might help.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay! That is it! I am one hundred percent certain we have everything we need.
:'''Rarity''': And I am one hundred percent certain Twilight is going to love it.
:'''Applejack''': She sure is!
:'''Rarity''': Love, darling!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Absolutely-tootly!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, definitely!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course!
:'''Spike''': Let's meet back here in the morning and give her the present before everypony leaves for the coronation.
:'''Main ponies''': [cheer]

:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sorry, I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you—
:'''Spike''': There's no time!
:[smack!]
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So... I'll just give this to her ''after'' the coronation, I guess.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, it wasn't exactly the coronation I was expecting.
:'''Spike''': I think the only thing that actually worked out was giving Twilight our gift.
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah. That seemed to go okay.
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe you two put this whole book together.
:'''Rarity''': It is a truly wonderful keepsake.
:'''Applejack''': I can't get over how many memories we've all made together.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] It's not really surprising. We're making one right now. And now! Now, too! And now! And now! And now! Now again!
:'''Spike''': We're glad you like it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's another one! Oh, that was a good one!
:[zip!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's the perfect present. Not that I need a book to remember all of you. But it's nice to know that no matter what, all I need to do to see you is open it.

:'''Nightmare Moon''': Now you will never see your princess, or your sun! The ''night'' will last ''forever''! [evil laugh]
:[All five ponies talking over each other: '''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry Twilight, we're here. '''Applejack''': Don't worry, we'll be there.]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right ''here''.
:'''Nightmare Moon''': What?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Applejack'', who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... ''honesty''! ''Fluttershy'', who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... ''kindness''! ''Pinkie Pie'', who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... ''laughter''! ''Rarity'', who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... ''generosity''! And ''Rainbow Dash'', who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... ''loyalty''! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
:'''Nightmare Moon''': You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside ''me'' when I realized that you all... are ''my friends''! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the ''spark'', that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... ''magic''!
:'''Nightmare Moon''': ''Nooo''! Nooo!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I just realized there's one problem with this book.
:'''Spike''': What's wrong with it?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It comes to an end. Pinkie is right. We're making new memories all the time. I don't think a book like this can ever be finished.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess not.
:'''Spike''': We'll just have to get started on volume two! [laughs]
:'''Mane Six''', '''Spike''', and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm so grateful for everything we've shared over the years. My memories of all of you are so special, I can't wait to start making more.
