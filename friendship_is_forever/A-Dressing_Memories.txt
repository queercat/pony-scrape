:[knock on door]
:[bell rings]
:'''Spike''': Uh, Rarity? Starlight and I kinda need your help.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, uh, I'm afraid I can't just now. Twilight will be here any moment for her fitting.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's why we're here. Spike and I are putting together something special for the coronation.
:'''Rarity''': Darling, we're all putting together something for the coronation. Be thankful you're not doing the gown. This is my fourteenth version!
:'''Spike''': This is different. It's from all of us. And it's kind of about all of us, too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I combined some ancient spells to make a magical scrapbook, and now all we need is some memories to go inside.
:'''Spike''': That way, Twilight can have a collection of memories to look at any time she wants. All we need you to do is—
:[knock on door]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity? It's Twilight. Are you sure we need to do another fitting? I don't think my sizes have changed.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Aah! Did we mention we want it to be a surprise?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': We want to be sure to get some of Twilight's own memories, so just get her talking about old times with you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'll do the rest.
:'''Rarity''': We get it, Starlight. You're good at magic.
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I thought maybe you weren't home.
:'''Rarity''': Not home? Darling, I would never miss a fitting.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course not, and I really appreciate you being so generous with your time. But are all these fittings really necessary?
:'''Rarity''': [scoffing] Darling! The perfect fit is imperative! And as for my time, well, I am far from the most generous pony in Equestria.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, that's exactly what you are.

:'''Steven Magnet''': [sobbing] What a world, what a ''world''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
:'''Steven Magnet''': Well, I don't know. I was just sitting here, minding my own business, when this tacky little cloud of purple smoke just whisked past me and tore half of my beloved mustache ''clean off'', and now I look simply ''horrid''. [wails]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, give me a break.
:'''Applejack''': That's what all the fuss is about?
:'''Rarity''': Why, of course it is. How ''can'' you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
:'''Steven Magnet''': [sniffs] I know.
:'''Rarity''': And your expertly coiffed mane.
:'''Steven Magnet''': Oh, I know, I know.
:'''Rarity''': Your fabulous manicure.
:'''Steven Magnet''': [gasp] It's so true!
:'''Rarity''': All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
:'''Steven Magnet''': It's true, I'm ''hideous''!
:'''Rarity''': I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
:'''Steven Magnet''': [yelp] What did you do that for?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, what are you-
:'''Steven Magnet''': [moans] Oh-hohohoho! My mustache. How wonderful.
:'''Rarity''': You look smashing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
:'''Rarity''': Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.

:'''Applejack''': Hey, look! That's the theatre where ''Hinny of the Hills'' is playin'!
:'''Rest of main cast''': [oohing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow, Rarity! How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings.
:'''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Cool!
:'''Rarity''': That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!
:'''Applejack''': So then you can do something nice for us!
:'''Fluttershy''': Like get us in to see ''Hinny of the Hills''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!
:'''Applejack''': It ''must'' be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed. Normally she doesn't even ''like'' musicals.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know. Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat? Who does that?
{{#lst:Generosity (song)|song}}

:'''Rarity''': Yes, I suppose I've had my generous moments. Although I haven't always been perfect.

:[sewing machines whirring]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working.
:'''Rarity''': Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, we're supposed to be watching ''Hinny of the Hills'' by then...
:'''Rarity''': Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see ''Hinny of the Hills'' tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! "Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! ''Isn't friendship magic?!''"
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you?
:'''Rarity''': What's gotten into ''you''?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!
:[door slams]
:[sewing machines whirring]

:[clicking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There. That's the last of them.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Finally!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''You're welcome''!

:'''Rarity''': [gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited.
:'''Rarity''': Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!

:'''Rarity''': [narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': You? Second in most creative? To whom?!

:[ponies cheering]
:[lightning cracks]
:'''Rarity''': [narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.

:'''Rarity''': I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold!
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Chop chop! Everypony out!
:'''Upper class ponies''': [indignant chattering]
:'''Rarity''': We've got work to do!
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': This will take all of my considerable skills... [humming to self]
:[scribbling]
:'''Rarity''': ...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional?
:'''Rarity''': Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing ''big'', we're doing ''bold''! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You mean ''my'' hooves.
:'''Rarity''': Yes, that's what I said – ''my'' hooves.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas.
:[sound of wrenching]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': How about a nice yellow fringe on top?
:'''Rarity''': [muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly ''big''! And that yellow is the least ''bold'' color I can imagine!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this.
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, precious face, "old-timey" is just another word for passé. Remember, ''big'' and ''bold''! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But we're supposed to be doing this together!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, ''we'' just finished. ''Voila!'' I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't ''big'' and ''bold'', I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful? [humming to self]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sighs] Right... Wonderful...

:'''Rarity''': I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my...
:'''Discord''': [laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?
:'''Rarity''': Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!

:'''Rarity''': Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome ''hunk'' of a diamond? Now to get you home. [grunts]
:[wall crash]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
:'''Rarity''': What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! [grunting]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe those weren't your best moments. But I can't think of a single pony who's never made a mistake.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What was that?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is there somepony else here?
:'''Rarity''': No! I mean, yes. Well, not exactly. You see, I asked that delightful family of raccoons from my shop in Manehattan to help out. [forced laugh] Smoky! Softpad! Careful with the [through gritted teeth] expensive fabrics! [clears throat] Yes, well, where were we? Uh... [gasps] Ah, yes. It's so nice to have a chance to reminisce. Everypony's so busy with the coronation. Still can't believe it's happening. [laughs] You really are an inspiration to ponies everywhere.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I suppose so. But honestly, you've always been an inspiration to me.
:'''Rarity''': Me? What ever for?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you kidding? You basically built a fashion empire from scratch.

:'''"Waxton"''': This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen!
:[ponies chattering]

:'''Rarity''': [reading] "In the end, Rarity's grand opening was a smashing success! True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells..." [to ponies] Oh, heavens, I think he means you. [continues reading] "...came together and created the perfect boutique. A vision of Rarity combined with the expertise of her friends! This reporter, for one, is a believer." [to ponies] Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We all figured you had enough on your mind.
:'''Applejack''': And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect.
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] "Ne'er-do-wells" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that.

:'''Rarity''': I appreciate hearing how much I'm appreciated. [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course I appreciate you. And I'm definitely not the only one.

:'''Spike''': [licks lips]
:'''Rarity''': You've been very patient today, Spike. And for that, you get the finest reward. This is from me to you.
:'''Rarity''': Is something wrong, Spike?
:'''Spike''': No. It's ''perfect''.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, it is very noble of you...
:'''Spike''': Shhh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [quieter] ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
:'''Spike''': Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.

:'''Sir Spike''': I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs! Ah. There you are, you mangy mutts.
:'''Rover''': Who are you calling mutts? Unleash the hounds! [blows dog whistle]
:'''Mook dogs''': [barking] [yelping]
:'''Sir Spike''': Now, where is Lady Rarity?
:'''Lady Rarity''': [gasp] Spike! I knew you would save me!
:'''Sir Spike''': Nothing could stop me, milady.
:'''Lady Rarity''': Ohohohoh, Spike. You are my... hero. [smooch]
:'''Sir Spike''': Mmmmmm...

:'''Applejack''': Whoa there, lover boy!

:'''Spike''': Um, Applejack, is it against the rules to trade names? Like if I had a better idea for somepony special? I mean specific?
:'''Applejack''': If you can figure out who has the pony you want and they're okay with tradin', I guess it's fine.
:'''Spike''': Great! So, uh, who do you—?
:'''Applejack''': I don't have Rarity.
:'''Spike''': What?! That's not who I—!
:'''Applejack''': Uh-huh.

:'''Spike''': Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't have Rarity!
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Oh! [chuckles] How's your shopping going, Spike?
:'''Spike''': Uh, fine!
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Which pony did you get?
:'''Spike''': I can't... remember?
:'''Rarity''': I've got Applejack, darling. She's going to adore her present. There's a brilliant designer in Manehattan – Fedora Felt – who makes the most marvelous hats. I asked for a new take on western chic that would be the envy of every farm pony in Equestria.
:'''Spike''': That's a great gift, Rarity. I hope I can find something for ''my'' pony as special as you are. Uh, ''she'' is! U-Uh, bye!
:[zip!]

:'''Spike''': Hey, Fluttershy! Thinking of getting that for your Hearthswarming Helper?
:'''Fluttershy''': Mm-hmm. She loves shiny things.
:'''Spike''': [overacted] I wish I knew what ''my'' secret pony wanted. She's so hard to shop for.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no. Maybe I could help. Unless you don't want to—
:'''Spike''': Rainbow Dash.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! I was just talking to Rainbow Dash about these—
:'''Spike''': Great idea! We ''should'' trade ponies!
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait. Trade?
:'''Spike''': Well, Applejack said it's not against the rules. And you know what Rainbow Dash likes, so it's perfect. [gasps] Rarity?! What a surprise! [chuckles] Thanks!
:[zip!]

:'''Rarity''': Over the years, my relationship with Spike has changed, but it will always be very special.
:[crunch!]
:'''Spike''': Ow!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It sounds like those raccoons need help.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We should check and make sure the raccoons are okay.
:'''Rarity''': No! I mean... No, you can't move. Uh, for the fitting, you see. If you start to move too much, then we'll have to do it all over again. [nervous laugh] So... I, uh, I will go check on my animal assistants.
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [hushed] What exactly are you doing back here?! Surely you have enough memories by now!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh... almost?
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': Now, where were we? I must say, I'm quite enjoying this fitting. I may not be the ruler of Equestria, but it is nice to hear how I've inspired ponies with my meager talent for fashion. [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, come on, Rarity. Of course you have a knack for design, but you're a lot more than that.

:'''Rarity''': Perhaps ''I'' should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring.
:'''Castle Guard 1''': It is. I've counted all three hundred and forty five bolts in the ceiling tiles two hundred and ninety three times!
:'''Rarity''': And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but ''if'' you took a break, you ''more'' than deserved it.
:'''Castle Guard 1''': Oh, you're right. We don't get a lot of recognition for what we do.
:'''Spearhead''': Except for last night when somepony was nice enough to leave a cake for us. So we did take one little break when we ate that cake.
:'''Rarity''': What kind of cake was it?
:'''Spearhead''': Cherry with a custard filling.
:'''Rarity''': Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?
:'''Castle Guard 1''': Chocolate.
:'''Rarity''': Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?
:'''Castle Guard 1''': It was.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh, ''who cares'' how it was decorated?!
:'''Rarity''': [narrating] ''Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing.''

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Music is very relaxing. [strums guitar]
:'''Rarity''': Sure... Hmm.
:[hard rock solo]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Much better.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blows]

:'''Lord Tirek''': 'Cause when you have to protect yourself, you don't have time for anypony else.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Too bad you never taught ''that'' in school.
:[magic humming]
:[crunch!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': [groans]

:'''Rarity''': [sniffles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, are you okay?
:'''Rarity''': Of course I am. It's just lovely to hear when a friend thinks highly of you. [clears throat] All right. Looks like they— ''I'' have everything I need.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Really? Are you sure you'll be able to finish this dress in time?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. [laughing] Oh, that's not your coronation gown. I finished that weeks ago.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! It's gorgeous. But what is ''this''?
:'''Rarity''': That is a backup. One can never be too careful when it comes to a coronation. I like to have all of my bases covered.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Add that to the list of things I'll never forget about you, Rarity!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': Ohhhh!
